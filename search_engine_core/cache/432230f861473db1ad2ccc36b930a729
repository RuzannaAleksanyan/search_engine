victorious
fox
also
joined
the

for

in

failed
however
paramount
viacom
changed
its

on

1994
it
announced
it
would
sell

for
fox
for
more
than
200
million
equivalent
to
373
million
in

dollars
88
that
transaction
gave
the

the
cash
to
then
turn
around
and
buy
two
of
combined
s
stations
wgbs

and
wbfs
tv
in
miami
to
become
upn

89
the
fcc
approved
the
deal
in
august
1995
as
well
as
a
waiver
for
fox
to
own
wtxf
tv

in

simultaneously

fox
made
major
changes
for

philadelphia

at

eight
year
license
renewal
the

and
democracy
project
filed
a
petition
against
the
renewal
with
the
fcc
seeking
greater
scrutiny
of
the
network
and
fox
television
stations
joined
by
former
fox
executive
preston
padden
and
using
evidence
brought
to
light
in
the
dominion
voting
systems
v
fox
news
network
case
the
petition
sought
denial
of
the
license
renewal
over
fox
corporation
s
alleged
misdeeds
citing
the
station
s
airing
of
such
national
news
programs
as
fox
news
sunday
and
linking
them
to
the
january
6
united
states
capitol
attack
in
the
petition
padden
wrote
fox
has
undermined
our
democracy
and
has
radicalized
a
segment
of
our
population
by
presenting
knowingly
false
narratives
about
the
legitimacy
of
the
2020
election
in
my
opinion
this
type
of
reporting
was
a
significant
contributing
factor
to
the
riots
in
the
capitol
on

2021

kellner
the
architect

fox
network
in
the
1980s
also
filed
informal
objections
to
the
renewal
sikes
warned
that
the
fcc
had
let
the
requirement
to
operate
in
the
public
interest
become
perfunctory
and
called
for
the
renewal
to
be
closely
scrutinized
in
public
hearings
and
courtrooms
while
kellner
wrote
if
the
character
requirement
for
broadcast
licensees
is
to
have
any
meaning
the
fcc
must
designate
the
application
for
a
hearing

evaluate
the
murdochs
fox

character
qualifications
to
operate

fox
criticized
the
relief
sought
by

as
a
violation
of

of
