during

2010s
the
genre
s
contribution
to
cinema
was
questioned
martin
scorsese
in
an
interview
with
empire
magazine
commented
that
the
closest
i
can
think
of
them
as
well
made
as
they
are
with
actors
doing
the
best
they
can
under
the
circumstances
is
theme
parks
it
isn
t
the
cinema
of
human
beings
trying
to
convey
emotional
psychological
experiences
to
another
human
being
he
stated
that
the
marvel
films
were
not
cinema
106
he
later
added
that
he
was
worried
about
studios
overreliance
on
the
format
because
in
many
places
around
this
country
and
the
world
franchise
films
are
now
your
primary
choice
if
you
want
to
see
something
on
the
big
screen
it
s
a
perilous
time
in
film
exhibition
and
there
are
fewer
independent
theaters
than
ever
107
in
that
new
york
times
essay
he
also
credited
the
work
of
people
who
make
these
films
writing
many
franchise
films
are
made
by
people
of
considerable
talent
and
artistry
you
can
see
it
on
the
screen
the
fact
that
the
films
themselves
don
t
interest
me
is
a
matter
of
personal
taste
and
temperament
i
know
that
if
i
were
younger
if
i
d
come
of
age
at
a
later
time
i
might
have
been
excited
by
these
pictures
and
maybe
even
wanted
to
make
one
myself
he
wrote
adding
but
i
grew
up
when
i
did
and
i
developed
a
sense
of
movies
of
what
they
were
and
what
they
could
be
that
was
as
far
from
the
marvel
universe
as
we
on
earth
are
from
alpha
centauri
107
criticism
of
marvel
studios
films
continued
with
jennifer
aniston
stating
that
marvel
movies
are
diminishing
and
believed
that
there
should
be
a
resurgence
of
the
era
of
meg
ryan
let
s
get
the
terms
of
endearment
back
out

denis
villeneuve
dismissed
too
many
marvel
films
being
a
cut
and
paste
of
others
109
and
roland
emmerich
stating
that
large
blockbuster
films
such
as
the
mcu
and
star
wars
films
were
ruining
our
industry
a
little
since
nobody
does
anything
original
anymore
110
however
in
march
2022
nicolas
cage
stated
that
marvel
has
done
a
really
excellent
job
of
entertaining
the
whole
family
they
put
a
lot
of
thought
into
it
i
mean
it
s
definitely
had
a
big
progression
from
when
i
was
doing
the
first
two
ghost
rider
movies
kevin
feige
or
whoever
is
behind
that
machine
has
found
a
masterful
way
of
weaving
the
stories
together
and
interconnecting
all
the
characters
what
could
be
wrong
with
wholesome
entertainment
that
is
appealing
to
the
parents
and
the
children
and
gives
people
something
to
look
forward
to
cage
asked
i
just
i
don
t
see
what
the
issue
is
111
some
media
commentators
have
attributed
the
increased
popularity
of
superhero
franchises
in
the
new
millennium
to
the
social
and
political
climate
in
western
society
since
the
september
11
attacks
112
although
others
have
argued
advances
in
special
effects
technology
have
played
a
more
significant
role
113
others
have
postulated
that
its
box
office
dominance
is
in
part
due
to
its
flexibility
a
shared
trait
from
its
original
publishing
origins
namely
the
editorial
realities
of
comic
book
publishing
which
can
have
series
running
for
decades
encouraged
writers
to
resort
to
a
variety
of
story
situations
so
diverse
from
the
fantastic
to
the
relatively
realistic
for
so
long
and
so
often
that
it
has
become
an
expected
element
of
the
genre
to
have
such
adaptability
114
for
example
with
the
common
element
being
that
they
all
feature
heroes
with
extraordinary
abilities
and
typically
in
a
distinctive
costume
many
successful
superhero
films
have
used
a
plethora
of
genres
such
as
horror
blade
psychological
thriller
unbreakable
period
drama
captain
america
the
first
avenger
space
opera
guardians
of
the
galaxy
family
film
the
incredibles

strange
neo
noir
the
dark

political

captain

western

115
however
there
is
additional
questioning
as
to
how
broad
or
vague
the
superhero
genre
is
and
whether
it
could
be
legitimately
classified
as
a
film
genre
at
all
when
the
basic
definition
is
that
of
a
benevolent
hero
or
antihero
with
superhuman
abilities
in
which
case
many
other
films
not
traditionally
associated
as
superhero
plots
would
fall
under
the
description
116
writer
alan
moore
a
veteran
of
the
comics
industry
known
for
his
work
on
watchmen
v
for
vendetta
batman
the
killing
joke
and
from
hell
has
expressed
criticism
of
modern
superhero
movies
in
general
which
he
once
called
a
blight
to
cinema
and
also
to
culture
to
a
degree
he
said
in
an
october
2022
interview
with
the
guardian
that
the
popularization
of
the
genre
on
the
part
of
adults
is
an
infantilization
that
can
act
as
a
precursor
to
fascism
lamenting
at
how
deeply
such
films
became
part
of
the
culture
moore
commented
117
118
i
will
always
love
and
adore
the
comics
medium
but
the
comics
industry
and
all
of
the
stuff
attached
to
it
just
became
unbearable
hundreds
of
thousands
of
adults
are
lining
up
to
see
characters
and
situations
that
had
been
created
to
entertain
the
12
year
old
boys
and
it
was
always
boys
of
50
years
ago
i
didn
t
think
that
superheroes
were
adult
fare
i
think
that
this
was
a
misunderstanding
born
of
what
happened
in
the
1980s
to
which
i
must
put
my
hand
up
to
a
considerable
share
of
the
blame
though
it
was
not
intentional
when
things
like
watchmen
were
first
appearing
there
were
an
awful
lot
of
headlines
saying
comics
have
grown
up
i
tend
to
think
that
no
comics
hadn
t
grown
up
there
were
a
few
titles
that
were
more
adult
than
people
were
used
to
but
the
majority
of
comics
titles
were
pretty
much
the
same
as
they
d
ever
been
it
wasn
t
comics
growing
up
i
think
it
was
more
comics
meeting
the
emotional
age
of
the
audience
coming
the
other
way
117
118
during
a
september
2023
interview
with
the
telegraph
moore
reiterated
this
view
saying
that
what
had
appealed
to
him
most
about
output
from
comics
publishers
was
no
more
saying
now
they
re
called
graphic
novels
which
sounds
sophisticated
and
you
can
charge
a
lot
more
for
them
these
innocent
and
inventive
and
imaginative
superhero
characters
from
the
40s
50s
and
60s
are
being
recycled
to
a
modern
audience
as
if
they
were
adult
fare
during
that
same
interview
journalist
jake
kerridge
asked
moore
if
it
was
true
that
he
divided
the
money
he
had
received
from
onscreen
adaptations
of
his
work
among
the
writers
and
other
staffpersons
of
those
productions
moore
replied
i
no
longer
wish
it
to
even
be
shared
with
them
i
don
t
feel
with
the
recent
films
that
they
have
stood
by
what
i
assumed
were
their
original
principles
so
i
asked
for
dc
comics
to
send
all
of
the
money
from
any
future
tv
series
or
films
to
black
lives
matter
119

by
the
2020s
the
term
superhero
fatigue
had
emerged
to
describe
audiences
increasing
exhaustion
of
overly
homogeneous
superhero
films
as
evidenced
by
diminishing
box
office
returns
and
poor
critical
reception
in
particular
the
marvel
cinematic
universe
has
been
criticized
for
oversaturating
the
market
with
its
expansion
to
streaming
beginning
with
phase
four
prompting
marvel
studios
to
begin
rethinking
its
annual
output
