etymology
edit
copenhagen
s
name
københavn
in
danish
reflects
its
origin
as
a
harbour
and
a
place
of
commerce
the
original
designation
in
old
norse
from
which
danish
descends
was
kaupmannahǫfn
ˈkɔupˌmɑnːɑˌhɔvn
cf
modern
icelandic
kaupmannahöfn
ˈkʰœipˌmanːaˌhœpn
faroese
keypmannahavn
meaning
merchants
harbour
by
the
time
old
danish
was
spoken
the
capital
was
called
køpmannæhafn
with
the
current
name
deriving
from
centuries
of
subsequent
regular
sound
change
the
english
cognates
of
the
original
name
would
be
chapman
s
haven
12
the
english
chapman
german
kaufmann
dutch
koopman
swedish
köpman
danish
købmand
and
icelandic
kaupmaður
share
a
derivation
from
latin
caupo
meaning
tradesman
however
the
english
term
for
the
city
was
adapted
from
its
low
german
name
kopenhagen
copenhagen
s
swedish
name
is
köpenhamn
a
direct
translation
of
the
mutually
intelligible
danish

recent
archaeological
finds
in
connection
with
work
on
the
city
s
metropolitan
rail
system
revealed
the
remains
of
a
large
merchant
s
mansion

excavations
in
pilestræde
have
also
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
well
from
the
late
12th
century
the
remains
of
an
ancient
church
with
graves
dating
to
the
11th
century
have
been
unearthed
near
where
strøget
meets

these
finds
indicate
that
copenhagen
s
origins
as
a
city
go
back
at
least
to
the
11th
century
substantial
discoveries
of
flint
tools
in
the
area
provide
evidence
of
human
settlements
dating
to
the
stone
age

many
historians
believe
the
town
dates
to
the
late
viking
age
and
was
possibly
founded
by

the
natural
harbour
and
good
herring
stocks
seem
to
have
attracted
fishermen
and
merchants
to

on
a
seasonal
basis
from
the
11th
century
and
more
permanently
in
the

were
probably
centred

the
earliest

mention
of

to
it

traditionally
copenhagen
s
founding
has
been
dated
to
bishop
absalon
s
construction
of
a
modest
fortress
on
the
little
island
of
slotsholmen
in
1167
where
christiansborg
palace
stands

the
construction
of

pirates
who
plagued
the
coastline
during
the
12th
century

defensive
ramparts
and

were

withdraw
destroying

34
copenhagen
is
often
considered
to
be
nelson

hardest
fought
battle
surpassing
even
the
heavy
fighting
at

it

the
second
battle
of
copenhagen
or
the
bombardment
of
copenhagen
16
august
5
september
1807
was
from
a
british
point
of
view
a
preemptive
attack
on
copenhagen
targeting
the
civilian
population
to
yet
again
seize
the
dano
norwegian
fleet
37
but
from
a
danish
point
of
view
the
battle
was
a
terror
bombardment
on
their
capital
particularly
notable
was
the
use
of
incendiary
congreve
rockets
containing
phosphorus
which
cannot
be
extinguished
with
water
that
randomly
hit
the
city
few
houses
with
straw
roofs
remained
after
the
bombardment
the
largest
church
vor
frue
kirke
was
destroyed
by
the
sea
artillery
several
historians
consider
this
battle
the
first
terror
attack
against
a
major
european
city
in
modern
times
38
the
british
landed
30
000
men
they
surrounded
copenhagen
and
the
attack
continued
for
the
next
three
days
killing
some
2
000
civilians
and
destroying
most
of
the
city
39
the
devastation
was
so
great
because
copenhagen
relied
on
an
old
defence
line
whose
limited
range
could
not
reach
the
british
ships
and
their
longer
range
artillery
40
despite
the
disasters
of
the

copenhagen

to
accommodate
those
who
came
from

provinces
to
participate
in

industrialization
this
dramatic
increase
of
space
was
long
overdue
as
not
only
were
the

ramparts
out

bad
