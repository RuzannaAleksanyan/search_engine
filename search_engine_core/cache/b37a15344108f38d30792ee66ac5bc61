and

as
the
game
s
story
progresses
it
is
revealed
that
furina
is
actually
the
human
part
of
the
hydro
archon
focalors
focalors
was
the
successor
of
the
first
hydro
archon
egeria
who
granted
humanity
to
the
oceanids
of
fontaine
an
act
the
heavenly
principles
considered
sinful
for
egeria
s
transgression
the
heavenly
principles
prophesied
that
fontaine
would
be
destroyed
by
means
of
a
great
flood
which
would
revert
the
people
of
fontaine
to
their
oceanid
state
to
prevent
this
prophecy
and
outsmart
the
heavenly
principles
focalors
separated
her
divinity
and
humanity
around
500
years
before
the
events
of
the
game
leaving
furina
as
her
human
half
11
furina
possesses
no
divine
powers
but
she
has
been
cursed
to
remain
forever
young
as
long
as
focalors
is
still
the
hydro
archon
in
the
centuries
since
she
becoming
fontaine
s
leader
furina
has
been
forced
to
isolate
herself
and
oppress
her
inner
thoughts
if
she
were
to
give
up
the
role
she
would
risk
bringing
the
prophecy
to
pass
by
the
time
the
player
meets
furina
she
is
a
completely
different
person
than
she
was
when
she
became
the
leader
of
fontaine

at
the
end
of
her
story
the
player
and
neuvillette
fontaine
s
chief
justice
and
the
current
reincarnation
of
the
hydro
dragon
sovereign
b
discover
furina
to
be
a
fraud
and
not
a
true
archon
leading
to
furina
being
placed
on
trial
to
force
her
to
reveal
her
true
identity
the
trial
ends
with
furina
being
declared
guilty
whereupon
focalors
appears
to
neuvillette
the
true
archon
admits
that
she
forced
furina
to
masquerade
as
fontaine
s
archon
for
the
last
five
centuries
with
furina
pretending
to
be
the
archon
focalors
was
then
free
to
secretly
accumulate
enough
divine
energy
to
subvert
the
prophecy
of
the
heavenly
principles
and
return
her
authority
to
its
rightful
owner
neuvillette
just
as
fontaine
begins
to
flood
focalors
executes
herself
transferring
her
power
to
neuvillette
neuvillette
uses
his
regained
authority
to
halt
the
flood
and
forgive
the
people
of
fontaine
of
their
sins
this
prevents
their
deaths
and
foils
the
heavenly
principles
schemes
with
focalors
death
furina
s
curse
of
immortality
is
broken
and

departs
to
live
her
life

a
normal
human
with

six
archons
remaining

three
companions

summon
a
single
companion

heals
the
active

another
ability
to
grant
damage
buffs
to
the
entire
party

on
how
much
health

integrated
various
aspects

and
dance
into

highlighted
several
elements
of
her
design
that
stood
out
to
him
particularly
how
her
ribbon
tied
her
to
an

and
how
french
elements
of
her
outfit
such
as
the
raff
collar
and
the
iris
pattern
on
her
cuffs
and
hat
demonstrated
the

her
lightweight
dress
and

and
complimented

appeal
to
non

portraying
her
as
a
musical
star
with
a
cheerful
and
operatic
temperament
