history
edit
a
1960s
proposal
for
a
grand
tour
to
study
the
outer
planets
led
nasa
to
begin
work
on
a
mission
during
the
early
1970s
18
information
gathered
by
the
pioneer
10
spacecraft
helped
engineers
design
voyager
to
better
cope
with
the
intense
radiation

19
still
shortly
before
launch
strips

kitchen

applied
to
certain
cables
to
improve
radiation
shielding

initially
voyager
1
was
planned
as
mariner
11
of
the
mariner
program
due
to
budget
cuts
the
mission
was
reduced
to
a
flyby
of
jupiter
and
saturn
and
renamed
the
mariner

the
name
was
changed
to
voyager

began
to

a
distance
of
about
349
000
kilometers
217
000

from

most
observations
of

the

the
greatest
surprise

encountered

in

when
the

came
within

of

the

detected

of

and
its
remote

instruments
studied
the
atmospheres
of

and
its
giant

46
voyager
1
found
that
about
seven
percent
of
the
volume
of
saturn
s
upper
atmosphere
is
helium
compared
with
11
percent
of
jupiter
s
atmosphere
while
almost
all
the
rest
is
hydrogen
since
saturn
s
internal
helium
abundance
was
expected
to
be
the
same
as
jupiter
s
and
the
sun
s
the
lower
abundance
of
helium
in
the
upper
atmosphere
may
imply
that
the
heavier
helium
may
be
slowly
sinking
through
saturn
s
hydrogen
that
might
explain
the
excess
heat
that
saturn
radiates
over
energy
it
receives
from
the
sun
winds
blow
at
high
speeds
on
saturn
near
the
equator
the
voyagers
measured
winds
about
500
m
s
1
100
mph
the
wind
blows
mostly
in
an
easterly
direction
42
the
voyagers
found
aurora
like
ultraviolet
emissions
of
hydrogen
at
mid
latitudes
in
the
atmosphere
and
auroras
at
polar
latitudes
above
65
degrees
the
high
level
auroral
activity
may
lead
to
the
formation
of
complex
hydrocarbon
molecules
that
are
carried
toward
the
equator
the
mid
latitude
auroras
which
occur
only
in
sunlit
regions
remain
a
puzzle
since
bombardment
by
electrons
and
ions
known
to
cause
auroras
on
earth
occurs
primarily
at
high
latitudes
both
voyagers
measured
the
rotation

images
taken
by
pioneer
11
in

had
indicated
the
atmosphere
was
substantial
and
complex
further
increasing
interest
the
titan
flyby
occurred
as
the
spacecraft
entered
the
system
to
avoid
any
possibility
of
damage

used
to
determine

atmosphere
s
composition
density
and

titan
s
mass
was
also
measured
by
observing
its
effect
on
the
probe
s
trajectory
the
thick
haze
prevented
any
visual
observation
of
the
surface
but
the
measurement
of
the
atmosphere
s
composition
temperature
and
pressure
led
to
speculation
that
lakes
of
liquid
hydrocarbons
could
exist
on
the
surface
47
because
observations
of
titan
were
considered
vital
the
trajectory
chosen
for
voyager
1
was
designed
around
the
optimum
titan
flyby
which
took
it
below
the
south

89
a

finding
that

that
