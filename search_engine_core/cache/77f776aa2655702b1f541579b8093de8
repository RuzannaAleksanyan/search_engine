its

when
the

the

had
just
introduced
a
multi

system
in
croatia
and

elections
for

the
hdz
began
as
a
nationalist
party

president
tuđman

officials
traveled
abroad
and
gathered
large
financial
contributions
from
croatian
expatriates
on
the
eve
of
the
1990
parliamentary
elections
the
ruling
league
of
communists
of
croatia
saw
such
tendencies
within
the
hdz
as
an
opportunity
to
remain
in
power
at
the
beginning
of
democracy
the
communists
called
hdz
the
party
of
dangerous
intentions
the
hdz
won
a
majority
in
the
croatian
parliament
and
croatia
then
part
of

became
one
of

as
it
strongly
advocated
croatian
independence
the
hdz
was
quite
unpopular
with
the
serb
minority
and
others
who
preferred
to
see
croatia
remain
inside
the
socialist
federal
republic
of
yugoslavia
this
was

of

factors
contributing
to
the
creation
of

krajina
and
the
subsequent

conflict
in
neighboring
bosnia
herzegovina
the
role
of
the
hdz
in
those
events
is
matter
of
controversy
even
in
croatia
where
some
tend
to
view
hdz
policy
in
the
early
stages
of
the
conflict
as
extremist
and
a
contributing
factor
in
the
escalation
of
violence
while
others
such
as
marko
veselica
s
croatian
democratic
party
see
the
hdz
as
having
appeased
serbia
and
the
yugoslav
people
s
army
therefore
being
responsible
for
croatia
s
unpreparedness
for
defense

the

also
began
to
lead
croatia
toward
a
political

economic
transition
from

notably
hdz
governments
implemented
privatization
in
the
country
in
a
manner
that
critics
consider
sub
optimal
and
at
times
possibly
illegal
due
to

selective
nature

privatization
controversy
according
to
the
hdz
this
process
proved
a
useful
distraction
from

ii
communist
nationalizations
it
was
the
hdz
in

were
under

ownership

right
to
finally
formally
register

version

several

who
became

under

were
tried
and
convicted
for
abuses
though
in
general
the
privatization
process
implemented
by
the
hdz
remained
unaltered
this
period
proved
to
be
a
low
point
for

not

dc
when
the
international
criminal
tribunal
icty
began
to
prosecute

this
provoked
a
major
backlash
among
the
croatian
public
as
the
opposition
party
the
hdz
supported
this
popular
discontent
and
actively
resisted
the
transfers
of
generals
to
the
icty
16
this
gradually
changed
as
the
hdz
and
its
new
leader
ivo
sanader
began
to
distance
themselves
from
the
more
extreme
rhetoric
becoming
perceived
as
moderates
this
tendency
continued
when
the
hsls
shifted
rightwards
making
sanader
s
hdz
and
hsls
appear
as

this
process
was
completed
in

to
be
associated

worst
excesses

challenged
sanader

accusing
him
of
betraying
tuđman

nationalist
legacy
at

it
looked
that

would
lose

with
the
help

tacit
support
of

sections
of

even
with

it
formed

nominally

independent
democratic
serb
party
and
the
croatian
party
of
pensioners
with
such
a
broad
and
diverse
mandate
the
sanader
led
government
vigorously
pursued
policies
that
amounted
to
the
implementation
of
the
basic
criteria
for
joining
the
european
union
such
as
the
return
of

rebuilding

improving

the

non

with
the
international
criminal
tribunal
for
the
former
yugoslavia
over
the
case
of

general

this
setback
brought
an
increase
in
eurosceptic
views
among
the
croatian
public
which
also
affected

this
opposition

itself
at

and
the
defection
of
glavaš

successfully
challenged

the

hard
pressed

right

croatian
party
of

and
croatian
democratic
assembly
of

during

campaign
a
vigorous
and
sometimes
ruthless
reaction
from
the
party
and
sanader
himself
together
with
some
capital
errors
from
sdp
convinced
part
of
the
far
right
electorate
to
support
the

to
prevent
what
they
perceived
as

sanader
formed
a
second

although
that
government
had
a
larger
majority
than
the
former
one
its
existence
remained
troubled
because
of
the
worsening
of
the
previously
good

situation
and
a
weariness
of
croatian
public
opinion
about
what
was
felt
to
be
an
overly
long
hdz
rule

another
major
drawback
was
the
slovenian
blocking

eu
accession
terms
until
border
disputes
between
the
two
countries
had
been
settled

although
this
ultimately
led
to
an
indefinite
suspension
of

negotiations
it
did
not
affect
the

s
popularity
in
this
case
as
would
be
expected
considering
croatian
staunch
patriotism
and
national
self
consciousness
all

nearly
every
