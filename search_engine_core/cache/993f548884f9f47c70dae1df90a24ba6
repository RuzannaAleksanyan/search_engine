was
related
through

to

s
father
died
when
he
was
three
and
he
was
raised
by
his
mother
and
paternal
grandfather
after
hadrian

adoptive
son
aelius

adopted
marcus
s
uncle
antoninus

antoninus
adopted
marcus

lucius

died

antoninus
became

acceded
to
the
throne
alongside
his
adoptive
brother
who
reigned
under
the
name
lucius
verus
under
his
rule
the
roman
empire
witnessed
heavy
military
conflict
in
the
east
the
romans
fought
successfully
with
a
revitalized
parthian
empire
and
the
rebel
kingdom
of
armenia
marcus
defeated
the
marcomanni
quadi
and
sarmatian
iazyges
in
the
marcomannic
wars
however
these
and
other
germanic
peoples
began
to
represent
a
troubling
reality
for
the
empire
he
reduced
the
silver
purity
of
the
roman
currency
the
denarius
the
persecution
of
christians
in
the
roman
empire
appears
to
have
increased
during
his
reign
but
his
involvement
in
this
is
unlikely
since
there
is
no
record
of
early
christians
in
the
2nd
century
calling
him
a
persecutor
and
tertullian
even
called
marcus
a
protector
of
christians

his
senatorial
prejudices
and
strong
opposition
to
imperial
expansion
obscure

he
found
it
difficult
nonetheless
he
would
criticize
himself
in
the
meditations
for
abusing
court
life
in
front
of
company
79
as
quaestor
marcus
would
have
had
little
real

work
to
do

would
read
imperial
letters
to
the
senate
when
antoninus
was
absent
and
would
do
secretarial
work
for
the
senators
80
but
he
felt
drowned
in
paperwork
and
complained
to
his
tutor
marcus
cornelius
fronto
i
am
so
out
of
breath
from
dictating
nearly
thirty
letters
81
he
was
being
fitted
for
ruling
the
state
in
the
words
of
his
biographer
82
he
was
required
to
make
a
speech
to
the
assembled
senators
as
well
making
oratorical
training
essential
for
the
job
83
on
1
january
145
marcus
was
made
consul
a
second
time
fronto
urged
him
in
a
letter
to
have
plenty
of
sleep
so
that
you
may
come
into
the
senate
with
a
good
colour
and
read
your
speech
with
a
strong
voice
84
marcus
had
complained
of
an
illness
in
an
earlier
letter
as
far
as
my
strength
is
concerned
i
am
beginning
to
get
it
back
and
there
is
no
trace
of
the
pain
in
my
chest
but
that
ulcer

i
am
having
treatment
and
taking
care
not
to
do
anything
that
interferes

it
85
never

marcus
was
praised
by
cassius
dio
writing
of
his
later
years
for
behaving
dutifully
in
spite
of
his
various
illnesses
86
in
april
145
marcus
married
faustina
legally
his
sister
as
had
been
planned
since
138
87
little
is
specifically
known
of
the
ceremony
but
the
biographer
calls
it
noteworthy
88
coins
were
issued
with
the
heads
of
the
couple
and
antoninus
as
pontifex
maximus
would
have
officiated

89
fronto
and
further
education
edit
after
taking
the
toga
virilis
in
136
marcus
probably
began
his
training
in
oratory
90
he
had
three
tutors
in
greek
aninus
macer
caninius
celer
and
herodes
atticus
and
one
in
latin
marcus
cornelius
fronto
the
latter
two
were
the
most
esteemed
orators
of
their
time
91
but
probably
did
not
become
his
tutors
until
his
adoption
by
antoninus
in
138
the
preponderance
of
greek
tutors
indicates
the
importance
of
the
greek
language
to
the
aristocracy
of
rome
92
this
was
the
age
of
the
second
sophistic
a
renaissance
in
greek
letters
although
educated
in
rome
in
his
meditations
marcus
would
write
his
inmost
thoughts
in
greek
93
atticus
was
controversial
an
enormously
rich
athenian
probably
the
richest
man
in
the
eastern
half
of
the
empire
he
was
quick
to
anger
and
resented
by
his
fellow
athenians
for
his
patronizing
manner
94
atticus
was
an
inveterate
opponent
of
stoicism
and
philosophic
pretensions
95
he
thought
the
stoics
desire
for
apatheia
was
foolish
they
would
live
a
sluggish
enervated
life
he
said
96
in
spite
of
the
influence
of
atticus
marcus
would
later
become
a
stoic
he
would
not
mention
herodes
at
all
in
his
meditations
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
would
come
into
contact
many
times
over
the
following
decades
97
fronto
was
highly
esteemed
in
the
self
consciously
antiquarian
world
of
latin
letters
98
he
was
thought
of
as
second
only
to
cicero
perhaps
even
an
alternative
to
him
99
note
6
he
did
not
care
much
for
atticus
though
marcus
was
eventually
to
put
the
pair
on
speaking
terms
fronto
exercised
a
complete
mastery
of
latin
capable
of
tracing
expressions
through
the
literature
producing
obscure
synonyms
and
challenging
minor
improprieties
in
word
choice
99
a
significant
amount
of
the
correspondence
between
fronto
and
marcus
has
survived
103
the
pair
were
very
close
using
intimate
language
such
as
farewell
my
fronto
wherever
you
are
my
most
sweet
love
and
delight
how
is
it
between
you
and
me
i
love
you
and
you
are
not
here
in
their
correspondence
104
marcus
spent
time
with
fronto
s
wife
and
daughter
both
named
cratia
and
they
enjoyed
light
conversation
105
he
wrote
fronto
a
letter
on
his
birthday
claiming
to
love
him
as
he
loved
himself
and
calling
on
the
gods
to
ensure
that
every
word
he
learnt
of
literature
he
would
learn
from
the
lips
of
fronto
106
his
prayers
for
fronto
s
health
were
more
than
conventional
because
fronto
was
frequently
ill
at
times
he
seems
to
be
an
almost
constant
invalid
always
suffering
107
about
one
quarter
of
the
surviving
letters
deal
with
the
man
s
sicknesses
108
marcus
asks
that
fronto
s
pain
be
inflicted
on
himself
of
my
own
accord
with
every
kind
of
discomfort
109
fronto
never
became
marcus
s
full
time
teacher
and
continued
his
career
as
an
advocate
one
notorious
case
brought
him
into
conflict
with
atticus
110
marcus
pleaded
with
fronto
first
with
advice
then
as
a
favour
not
to
attack
atticus
he
had
already
asked
atticus
to
refrain
from
making
the
first
blows
111
fronto
replied
that
he
was
surprised
to
discover
marcus
counted
atticus
as
a
friend
perhaps
atticus
was
not
yet
marcus
s
tutor
and
allowed
that
marcus
might
be
correct
112
but
nonetheless
affirmed
his
intent
to
win
the
case
by
any
means
necessary
t
he
charges
are
frightful
and
must
be
spoken
of
as
frightful
those
in
particular
that
refer
to
the
beating
and
robbing
i
will
describe
so
that
they
savour
of
gall
and
bile
if
i
happen
to
call
him
an
uneducated
little
greek
it
will
not
mean
war
to
the
death
113
the
outcome
of
the
trial
is
unknown
114
by
the
age
of
twenty
five
between
april
146
and
april
147
marcus
had
grown
disaffected
with
his
studies
in
jurisprudence
and
showed
some
signs
of
general
malaise
his
master
he
writes
to
fronto
was
an
unpleasant
blowhard
and
had
made
a
hit
at
him
it
is
easy
to
sit
yawning
next
to
a
judge
he
says
but
to
be
a
judge
is
noble
work
115
marcus
had
grown
tired
of
his
exercises
of
taking
positions
in
imaginary
debates
when
he
criticized
the
insincerity
of
conventional
language
fronto
took
to
defend
it
116
in
any
case
marcus
s
formal
education
was
now
over
he
had
kept
his
teachers
on
good
terms
following
them
devotedly
it
affected
his
health
adversely
his
biographer
writes
to
have
devoted
so
much
effort
to
his
studies
it
was
the
only
thing
the
biographer
could
find
fault
with
in
marcus
s
entire
boyhood
117
fronto
had
warned
marcus
against
the
study
of
philosophy
early
on
it
is
better
never
to
have
touched
the
teaching
of
philosophy
than
to
have
tasted
it
superficially
with
the
edge
of
the
lips
as
the
saying
is
118
he
disdained
philosophy
and
philosophers
and
looked
down
on
marcus
s
sessions
with
apollonius
of
chalcedon
and
others
in
this
circle
103
fronto
put
an
uncharitable
interpretation
of
marcus
s
conversion
to
philosophy
in
the
fashion
of
the
young
tired
of
boring
work
marcus
had
turned
to
philosophy
to
escape
the
constant
exercises
of
oratorical
training
119
marcus
kept
in
close
touch
with
fronto
but
would
ignore
fronto
s
scruples
120
apollonius
may
have
introduced
marcus
to
stoic
philosophy
but
quintus
junius
rusticus
would
have
the
strongest
influence
on
the
boy
121
note
7
he
was
the
man
fronto
recognized
as
having
wooed
marcus
away
from
oratory
123
he
was
older
than
fronto
and
twenty
years
older
than
marcus
as
the
grandson
of
arulenus
rusticus
one
of
the
martyrs
to
the
tyranny
of
domitian
r
81
96
he
was
heir
to
the
tradition
of
stoic
opposition
to
the
bad
emperors
of
the
1st
century
124
the
true
successor
of
seneca
as
opposed
to
fronto
the
false
one
125
marcus
thanks
rusticus
for
teaching
him
not
to
be
led
astray
into
enthusiasm
for
rhetoric
for
writing
on
speculative
themes
for
discoursing
on
moralizing
texts
to
avoid
oratory
poetry
and
fine
writing
126
philostratus
describes
how
even
when
marcus
was
an
old
man
in
the
latter
part
of
his
reign
he
studied
under
sextus
of
chaeronea
the
emperor
marcus
was
an
eager
disciple
of
sextus
the
boeotian
philosopher
being
often
in
his
company

lucius

had

asked
the
emperor
whom
he
met
on
his
way
where
he
was
going
to
and
on
what
errand
and
marcus
answered
it
is

even
for
an

learn

note

in
spite
of
their
nominal
equality
marcus
held
more
auctoritas
or
authority
than
lucius
he
had
been
consul
once
more
than
lucius
he
had
shared
in
antoninus
s
rule
and
he
alone
was
pontifex
maximus
162
it
would
have
been
clear
to
the
public
which
emperor
was
the
more
senior
161
as
the
biographer
wrote
verus
obeyed
marcus
as
a
lieutenant
obeys
a
proconsul
or
a
governor
obeys
the
emperor
163
immediately
after
their
senate
confirmation
the
emperors
proceeded
to
the
castra
praetoria
the
camp
of
the
praetorian
guard
lucius
addressed
the
assembled
troops
which
then
acclaimed
the
pair
as
imperatores
then
like
every
new
emperor
since
claudius
lucius
promised
the
troops
a
special
donativum
164
this
donative
however
was
twice
the
size
of
those
past
20
000
sesterces
5
000
denarii
per
capita
with
more
to
officers
in
return
for
this
bounty
equivalent
to
several
years
pay
the
troops
swore
an
oath
to
protect
the
emperors
165
the
ceremony
was
perhaps
not
entirely
necessary
given
that
marcus
s
accession
had
been
peaceful
and
unopposed
but
it
was
good
insurance
against
later
military
troubles
166
upon
his
accession
he
also
devalued
the
roman
currency
he
decreased
the
silver

antoninus
s
funeral
ceremonies
were
in
the
words
of
the
biographer
elaborate
168
if
his
funeral
followed
those
of
his
predecessors
his
body
would
have
been
cremated
on
a
pyre
at
the
campus
martius
and
his
spirit
would
have
been
seen
as
ascending
to
the
gods
home
in
the
heavens
marcus
and
lucius
nominated
their
father
for
deification
in
contrast
to
their
behaviour
during
antoninus
s
campaign
to
deify
hadrian
the
senate
did
not
oppose

166
in

with
his
will
antoninus

fortune
passed
on
to
faustina
170
marcus
had
little
need
of
his
wife
s
fortune
indeed
at
his
accession
marcus
transferred
part
of
his
mother

estate
to
his
nephew

faustina
was
three

marcus

178
marcus
and
lucius
proved
popular
with
the
people
of
rome
who
strongly
approved
of
their
civiliter
lacking
pomp
behaviour
the
emperors
permitted
free
speech
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
comedy
writer
marullus
was
able
to
criticize
them
without
suffering
retribution
as
the
biographer
wrote
no
one
missed
the
lenient
ways
of
pius
179

replaced

fronto
returned
to
his
roman
townhouse
at
dawn
on
28
march
having
left
his
home
in
cirta
as
soon
as
news
of
his
pupils
accession
reached
him
he
sent
a
note
to
the
imperial
freedman
charilas
asking
if
he
could
call
on
the
emperors
fronto
would
later
explain
that
he
had
not
dared
to
write
the
emperors
directly
183
the
tutor
was
immensely
proud
of
his
students
reflecting
on
the
speech
he
had
written
on
taking
his
consulship
in
143
when
he
had
praised
the
young
marcus
fronto
was
ebullient
there
was
then
an
outstanding
natural
ability
in
you
there
is
now
perfected

there
was
then

is

what
i
was
hoping
for
then
i
have
now
the
hope
has
become
a
reality
184
fronto
called
on
marcus
alone
neither
thought
to
invite
lucius
185
lucius
was
less
esteemed
by
fronto
than
his
brother
as
his
interests
were
on
a
lower
level
lucius
asked
fronto
to
adjudicate
in
a
dispute
he
and
his
friend
calpurnius
were
having
on
the
relative
merits
of
two
actors
186
marcus
told
fronto
of
his
reading
coelius
and
a
little
cicero
and
his
family
his
daughters
were
in
rome
with
their
great
great
aunt
matidia
marcus
thought
the
evening
air
of
the
country
was
too
cold
for
them
he
asked
fronto
for
some
particularly
eloquent
reading
matter
something
of
your
own
or
cato
or
cicero
or
sallust
or
gracchus
or
some
poet
for
i
need
distraction
especially
in
this
kind
of
way
by
reading
something
that
will
uplift
and
diffuse
my
pressing
anxieties
187
marcus
s
early
reign
proceeded
smoothly
he
was
able
to
give
himself
wholly
to
philosophy
and
the
pursuit
of
popular
affection
188
soon
however
he
would
find
he
had
many
anxieties
it
would
mean
the
end
of
the
felicitas
temporum
happy
times
that
the
coinage
of
161
had
proclaimed

fronto
s
letters
continued
through
marcus
s
early
reign
fronto
felt
that
because
of
marcus
s
prominence
and
public
duties
lessons
were
more
important
now
than
they
had
ever
been
before
he
believed
marcus
was
beginning
to
feel
the
wish
to
be
eloquent
once
more
in
spite
of
having
for
a
time
lost
interest
in
eloquence
194
fronto
would
again
remind
his
pupil
of
the
tension
between
his
role
and
his
philosophic
pretensions

you
can
attain
to
the
wisdom

195
the
early
days
of
marcus
s
reign
were
the
happiest
of
fronto
s
life
marcus
was
beloved
by
the
people
of
rome
an
excellent
emperor
a
fond
pupil
and
perhaps
most
importantly
as
eloquent
as
could
be
wished
196
marcus
had
displayed
rhetorical
skill
in
his
speech
to
the
senate
after
an
earthquake
at
cyzicus
it
had
conveyed
the
drama
of
the
disaster
and
the
senate
had
been
awed
not
more
suddenly
or
violently
was
the
city
stirred
by

marcus

was

his
first
consulship
was
in

so
he
was
probably
in
his
early
thirties
214
and
as
a
patrician
he
lacked
military
experience
marcus
had
chosen
a
reliable
man
rather
than
a
talented
one
215
marcus
took
a
four
day
public
holiday
at
alsium
a
resort
town
on
the
coast
of
etruria
he
was
too
anxious
to
relax

he
declared
that
he
would
not
speak
about
his
holiday
217
fronto
replied
what
do
i
not
know
that
you
went
to
alsium
with
the
intention
of
devoting
yourself
to
games
joking
and
complete
leisure
for
four
whole
days
218
he
encouraged
marcus
to
rest
calling
on
the
example
of
his
predecessors
antoninus
had
enjoyed
exercise
in

and

so
far
as
to
write
up
a
fable
about

division
of
the

and

marcus
had
apparently
been
spending
most
of
his
evenings
on
judicial
matters
instead
of
at
leisure
220
marcus
could
not
take
fronto

advice

hanging
over
me

can
hardly
be
begged
off

and
would
rest
often
but
this
devotion
to

who
knows
better
than

how
demanding
it
is
222
fronto
sent

he
was
stronger
and
healthier
than
marcus
the
argument
went
and
thus
more
suited
to
military
activity
227
lucius
s
biographer
suggests
ulterior
motives
to
restrain
lucius
s
debaucheries
to
make
him
thrifty
to
reform
his
morals
by
the
terror
of

to
realize
that
he
was

its
assent

remain
in

the
city
demanded
the
presence
of

emperor

spent

in

he
wintered
at

summered
at

germanic
tribes

other
nomadic
people
launched
raids
along
the
northern
border
particularly
into
gaul
and
across
the
danube
this
new
impetus
westwards
was
probably
due
to
attacks
from
tribes
further
east
a
first
invasion
by
the
chatti
in
the
province

germania

was
repulsed
in

more
dangerous
was
the
invasion
of
166
when
the

clients

roman
empire
since

crossed
the

sarmatian
iazyges
attacked

rivers

costoboci
coming
from
the
carpathian
area
invaded
moesia
macedonia

greece
after
a
long
struggle
marcus
managed
to
push
back
the
invaders
numerous
members
of
germanic
tribes
settled
in
frontier
regions
like
dacia
pannonia
germany
and
italy
itself
this
was
not
a
new
thing
but
this
time
the
numbers
of
settlers
required
the
creation
of
two
new
frontier
provinces
on
the
left
shore
of
the
danube
sarmatia
and
marcomannia
including
today
s
czech
republic
slovakia
and
hungary
some
germanic
tribes
who
settled
in
ravenna
revolted
and
managed
to
seize
possession
of
the
city
for
this
reason
marcus
decided
not
only
against
bringing
more
barbarians
into
italy
but
even
banished
those
who
had
previously
been
brought
there
272
legal
and
administrative
work
edit
like
many
emperors
marcus
spent
most
of
his
time
addressing
matters
of
law
such
as
petitions
and
hearing
disputes
273
but
unlike
many
of
his
predecessors
he
was
already
proficient
in
imperial
administration
when
he
assumed
power
274
he
took
great
care
in
the
theory
and
practice
of
legislation
professional
jurists
called
him
an
emperor
most
skilled
in
the
law
275
and
a
most
prudent
and
conscientiously
just
emperor
276
he
showed
marked
interest
in
three
areas
of
the
law
the
manumission
of
slaves
the
guardianship
of
orphans
and
minors
and
the
choice
of
city
councillors
decuriones
277
marcus
showed
a
great
deal
of
respect
to
the
roman
senate
and
routinely
asked
them
for
permission
to
spend
money
even
though
he
did
not
need
to
do
so
as
the
absolute
ruler
of
the
empire
278
in
one
speech
marcus
himself
reminded
the
senate
that
the
imperial
palace
where
he
lived
was
not
truly
his
possession
but
theirs
279
in
168
he
revalued
the

166
at

have
started
a
new
era

however
it
was
also
a
harbinger
of
something
much
more
ominous

to
mclaughlin

disease
caused
irreparable
damage
to
the
roman
maritime
trade
in
the
indian
ocean
as
proven
by
the
archaeological

marcus
did
not
meet
with
the
good
fortune
that
he
deserved
for
he
was
not
strong
in
body
and
was
involved
in
a
multitude
of
troubles
throughout
practically
his
entire
reign
but
for
my
part
i
admire
him
all
the
more
for
this
very
reason
that
amid
unusual
and
extraordinary
difficulties
he
both
survived
himself
and
preserved
the
empire
just
one
thing
prevented
him
from
being
completely
happy
namely
that
after
rearing
and
educating
his
son
in
the
best
possible
way
he
was
vastly
disappointed
in
him
this
matter
must
be

from

days
as
counsellor

he
remained
the

person

did

michael
grant
in

climax

writes
of

299
the
youth
turned
out
to
be
very
erratic
or
at
least
so
anti
traditional
that
disaster
was
inevitable
but
whether
or
not
marcus
ought
to
have
known
this
to
be
so
the
rejections
of
his
son
s
claims
in
favour
of
someone
else
would
almost
certainly
have
involved
one
of

civil

attitude
towards
christians
edit
in
the
first
two
centuries
of
the
christian
era
local
roman
officials
were
largely
responsible
for
the
persecution
of
christians
in
the
second
century
the
emperors
treated
christianity
as
a
local
problem
to
be
dealt
with
by
their
subordinates
300
the
number
and
severity
of
persecutions
of
christians
in
various
locations
of
the
empire
seemingly
increased
during
the
reign
of
marcus
aurelius
the
extent
to
which
the
emperor
himself
directed
encouraged
or
was
aware
of
these
persecutions
is
unclear
and
much
debated
by
historians
301
the
early
christian
apologist
justin
martyr
includes
within
his
first
apology
written
between
140
and
150
a
letter
from
marcus
aurelius
to
the
roman
senate
prior
to
his
reign
describing
a
battlefield
incident
in
which
marcus
believed
christian
prayer
had
saved
his
army
from
thirst
when
water
poured
from
heaven
after
which
immediately
we
recognized
the

desist
from

courses

legacy
and
reputation
edit
marcus
acquired
the
reputation
of
a
philosopher
king
within
his
lifetime
and
the
title
would
remain
after
his
death
both
dio
and
the
biographer
call
him
the
philosopher
325
326
christians
such
as
justin
martyr
athenagoras
and
eusebius
also
gave
him
the
title
327
the
latter
went
so
far
as
to
call
him
more
philanthropic
and
philosophic
than
antoninus
and
hadrian
and
set
him
against
the
persecuting
emperors
domitian
and
nero
to
make
the
contrast
bolder
328
the
historian
herodian
wrote
alone
of
the
emperors
he
gave
proof
of
his
learning
not
by
mere
words
or
knowledge
of
philosophical
doctrines
but
by
his
blameless
character
and
temperate
way
of
life

that
marcus
s
legacy
was
tragic
the
emperor
s
stoic
philosophy
which
is
about
self
restraint
duty
and
respect
for
others
was
so
abjectly
abandoned
by
the
imperial
line

anointed
on
his
death
