indicate
that

it
killed
approximately

of
low

propagated
over
bihar
and
west
bengal
india
with
a
trough
extending
east
across
bangladesh
and
into

the
system
remained
largely
stationary
throughout
the
day
through
26
april
on
that
day
another
low
approached
from
madhya
pradesh
and
in
conjunction
with
a
ridge
over
china
the
pressure
gradient
became
tighter
across
bangladesh
warm
moist
air
flowed
northeast
from
the
bay
of
bengal
while
cool
dry
air
flowed
south
from
the
himalayas
in
the
upper

above
the
low
strong
westerly
winds
from
the
jet
stream
created
ample
wind
shear
a
key
factor
in
the
development
of
supercell
thunderstorms
capable
of
producing
tornadoes
the
jet
stream
became
particularly
intense
on
26

an

a
focal
point

all
the

factors
served

a

touched
down
near
daulatpur
in
the

it
caused
tremendous
