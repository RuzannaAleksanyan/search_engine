in

in

writer
editor
stan

revolutionized
superhero
comics
by
introducing
superheroes
designed
to
appeal
to
older
readers
than
the
predominantly
child
audiences
of
the
medium
thus
ushering
what
marvel
later
called
the

28
broke
convention
with
other
comic
book
archetypes
of
the
time
by
squabbling
holding
grudges
both
deep
and
petty
and
eschewing
anonymity
or
secret
identities
in
favor
of
celebrity
status
subsequently
marvel
comics
developed
a
reputation
for
focusing
on
characterization
and
adult
issues
to
a
greater
extent
than
most
superhero
comics
before
them
a
quality
which
the
new
generation
of
older
readers
appreciated
29
this
applied
to
the
amazing
spider
man
title
in
particular
which
turned
out
to
be
marvel
s
most
successful
book
its
young
hero
suffered
from
self
doubt
and
mundane
problems
like
any
other
teenager
something
with
which
many
readers
could
identify
30
stan
lee
and
freelance
artist
and
eventual
co
plotter
jack
kirby
s
fantastic
four
originated
in
a
cold
war
culture
that
led
their
creators
to
revise
the
superhero
conventions
of
previous
eras
to
better
reflect
the
psychological
spirit
of
their
age
31
eschewing
such
comic
book
tropes
as
secret
identities
and
even
costumes
at
first
having
a
monster
as
one
of
the
heroes
and
having
its
characters
bicker
and
complain
in
what
was
later
called
a
superheroes
in
the
real
world
approach
the
series
represented
a
change
that
proved
to
be
a
great
success
32
marvel
often
presented
flawed
superheroes
freaks
and
misfits
unlike
the
perfect
handsome
athletic
heroes
found
in
previous
traditional
comic
books
some
marvel
heroes
looked
like
villains
and
monsters
such
as
the
hulk
and
the
thing
this
naturalistic
approach
even
extended
into
topical
politics
comics
historian
mike
benton
also
noted
in
the
world
of

communism

superman
rarely
crossed
national
borders
or
involved
himself
in
political
disputes
33
from
1962

34
all
these
elements
struck
a
chord
with
the
older
readers
including
college
aged
adults
in

spider

and
the
hulk
were
both
featured
in

alongside

kennedy
and
bob

35
in

writer
geoff
boucher
reflected
that
superman
and
dc
comics
instantly
seemed
like
boring
old
pat
boone
marvel
felt
like
the
beatles
and
the
british
invasion
it
was
kirby
s
artwork
with
its
tension
and
psychedelia
that
made
it
perfect
for
the
times
or
was
it
lee
s
bravado
and
melodrama
which
was
somehow
insecure
and
brash
at
the
same
time
36
in
addition
to
spider
man
and
the
fantastic
four
marvel
began
publishing
further
superhero
titles
featuring
such
heroes
and
antiheroes
as

daredevil
the

black

as

the

all
existing
in

alsonotesirwin
said
he
never
played
golf
with
goodman
so
the
story
is
untrue
i
heard
this
story
more
than
a
couple
of
times
while
sitting
in
the
lunchroom
at
dc
s
909
third
avenue
and
75
rockefeller
plaza
office
as
sol
harrison
and
production
chief
jack
adler
were
schmoozing
with
some
of
us
who
worked
for
dc
during
our
college
summers
t
he
way
i
heard
the
story
from
sol
was
that
goodman
was
playing
with
one
of
the
heads
of
independent
news
not
dc
comics
though
dc
owned
independent
news
as
the
distributor
of
dc
comics
this
man
certainly
knew
all
the
sales
figures
and
was
in
the
best
position
to
tell
this
tidbit
to
goodman
of
course
goodman
would
want
to
be
playing
golf
with
this
fellow
and
be
in
his
good
graces
sol
worked
closely
with
independent
news
top
management
over
the
decades
and
would
have
gotten
this
story
straight
from
the
horse
s
mouth
goodman
a
publishing
trend
follower
aware
of
the
jla
s
strong
sales
confirmably
directed
his
comics
editor
stan
lee
to
create
a
comic
book
series
about
a
team
of
superheroes
according
to

martin
mentioned
that
he
had
noticed
one
of
the
titles
published
by
national
comics
seemed
to
be
selling
better
than
most
it
was
a
book
called
the
sic
justice
league
of
america
and
it
was
composed
of
a
team
of
superheroes
if
the
justice
league
is
selling
spoke
he
why
don
t
we
put
out
a
comic
book
that
features
a
team
of
superheroes
