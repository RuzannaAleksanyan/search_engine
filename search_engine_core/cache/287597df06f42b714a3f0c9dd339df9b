etymology
edit
in
antiquity
the
term
arabia
encompassed
a
larger
area
than
the
current
term
arabian
peninsula
and
included
the
arabian
desert
and
large
parts
of
the
syrian
arabian
desert
during
the
hellenistic
period
the
area
was
known
as
arabia

aravia

arabia
felix
had
originally
been
used
for
the
whole
peninsula
and
at
other
times
only
for
the
southern
region
because
its
use
became
limited
to
the
south
the
whole
peninsula
was
simply
called
arabia
arabia
deserta
was
the

to

and
the

all
the
area
between

and

this
area
was
also
called
arabia
and
not
sharply
distinguished
from

imply
that

the

human
fossil
discovered

indicates
human
migrations
from
africa

arabia
occurred
around
this
time
48
the
arabian
peninsula
may
have
been
the
homeland
of
a
basal
eurasian
population
which
diverged
from
other
eurasians
soon
after
the
out
of
africa
migration
and
subsequently
became
isolated
until
it
started
to
mix
with
other
populations
in
the
middle
east
since
around
25
000
years
ago
these
different
middle
eastern
populations
would
later
spread
basal
eurasian
ancestry
via

revolution

all
of

eurasia

despite

spiritual
importance
in

arabia
soon
became
a
peripheral
region

the

medieval
islamic
states
were
based
at
various
times
in

cities

however
from

until

maintained
a

part

the
hejaz
their
domain
originally
comprised
only
the
holy
cities
of

medina

in
the
13th
century
it
was
extended
to
include
the
rest
of
the
hejaz
although
the
sharifs
exercised
at
most
times
independent
authority
in
the
hejaz
they
were
usually
subject
to
the
suzerainty
of
one
of
the
major
islamic
empires
