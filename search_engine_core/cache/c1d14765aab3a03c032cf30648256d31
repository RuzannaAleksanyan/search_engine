by
the
turn
of
the
21st
century
sudan
s
western
darfur
region
had
endured
prolonged
instability
and
social
strife
due
to
a
combination
of
racial
and
ethnic
tensions
and
disputes
over
land
and
water
in
2003
this
situation
erupted
into
a
full

rebellion

against
which
president
and
military
strongman
omar

vowed
to
use

the

violence
leading
to
charges

war
crimes
and

the
initial

left
approximately
300

prelude
edit
in
the
months
after
the
2021
coup
the
already
weak
sudanese
economy
steeply
declined
fueling
wide
protests
demanding
that
the

relinquish
power
back
to
civilian
authorities
81
tensions
arose
between
the
two
junta
leaders
over
al
burhan
s
restoration
to
office
of
old
guard
islamist
officials
who
had
dominated
the
omar
al
bashir
government
hemedti
saw
the
appointment
of
these
officials
as
a
signal
that
al
burhan
was
attempting
to
maintain
the
dominance
of
khartoum
s
traditional
elite
over
sudanese
politics
this
was
a
danger
to
the
rsf
s
political
position
as
said
elites
were
hostile
to
hemedti
due
to
his
ethnic
background
as
a
darfuri
arab
82
as
a
sign
of
the
growing
rift
between
him
and
al
burhan
hemedti
expressed
regret
over
the
october
2021
coup
66
tensions
between
the
rsf
and
the
saf
began
to
escalate
in
february
2023
as
the
rsf
began
to
recruit
members
across
sudan
81
throughout
february
and
early
march
the
military
built
up
in
the
sudanese
capital
of
khartoum
until
a
deal
was
brokered
on
11
march
and
the
rsf
withdrew
81
83
as
part
of
this
deal
negotiations
were
conducted
between
the
saf
rsf
and
civilian
leaders
yet
these
were
delayed
and
halted
by
political
disagreements
84
chief
among
the
disputes
was
the
integration
of
the
rsf
into
the
military
the
rsf
insisted
on
a
10
year
timetable
for
its
integration
into
the
regular
army
while
the
army
demanded
integration
within
two
years
85
86
other
contested
issues
included
the
status
given
to
rsf
officers
in
the
future
hierarchy
and
whether

be

following

efforts
by

to
negotiate

made
progress

the

s
weakened
position
made
them
more
eager
to
enter

previously
opposition
from

political
groups
to

had
prevented
al

a
day
before
the
meeting
was
due
the
sudanese
foreign
ministry
claimed
that
they
had
been
contacted
by
igad
informing
them
that
the
meeting
was
postponed
citing
technical
issues
211
instead
the

went
on
a
diplomatic
tour
travelling
on

and
meeting
with

african
national
leaders
212
one
visit
that
was
particularly
promoted
was
his
visit
to
rwanda

he
met
with

president
paul
kagame
visited
the
kigali

spoke

recovery
from
the
rwandan
genocide
as
a
model
for

follow

hemedti
also
met
with
former
prime

hamdok
and
his
taqaddum
organisation
in

with
the
rsf
agreeing
in

negotiated
with

taqaddum
to
release
political
prisoners
open
up
humanitarian
aid
corridors
and
negotiate
further
with

213
this
tour
was
regarded
by
observers
as
an
attempt
by
hemedti
to
portray
himself
as
the
leader
of
sudan
and
improve
his
international
image

his
reputation

al

why
the

sudan
suspended

igad
accusing
igad
of
violating

setting

legitimacy

inviting

accused

german
acronym

cautioned
against
misguided
analysis
and
oversimplification
of
the
reasons
and
warring
parties
in
his
analysis
of
international
reports
and
political
statements
he
named
three
misconceptions
about
the
origin
dynamics
and
impact
of
the
conflict
these
biased
views
concern
the
lack
of
international
attention
the
role
of
the
security
sector
and
the
interference
of
external
actors
stressing
the
importance
of
how
international
commentators
present
the
political
dimension
of
this
war
kurtz
described
often
neglected
and
complex
interrelations
between
these
three
central
aspects
and
wider
implications
in
particular
he
advised
commentators
to
call
the
war
an
ignored
conflict
rather
than
a
forgotten
conflict
and
a
war
between
the
main
armies
and
their
allies
at
the
expense
of
the
civilian
population
instead
of
a
war
between
two
generals
further
he
drew
attention
to
the
various
factors
of
external
influence
for
example
by
the
united
arab
emirates
egypt
or
lybia
involved
in
what

often
simply
called
