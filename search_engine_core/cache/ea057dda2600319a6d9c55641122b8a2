further
explained
that
a
low
pressure
system
in
the
upper
atmosphere
coupled
with
low
pressure
at
the
surface
had
acted
like
a
pressure
squeeze
on
the
air
that
squeeze
intensified
by
the
contrast
between
warmer
temperatures
at
ground
level
and
colder
temperatures
higher
up
created
the
conditions
for
the
powerful
thunderstorm

scientist
michael
mann
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
stated
that
three
low
pressure
systems
formed
a
train
of
storms
which
moved
along
the
jet
stream
toward
the
persian
gulf
the
strong
low
pressure
system
delivered
multiple
rounds
of
high
winds
and
heavy
rain

and
stated
that
rainfall
was
becoming

the

has
been
hit
by
heatwaves

cyclones
in

researchers
expect
an

some

quoted
specialist

linking
the
heavy
downpours
to
the
uae
s
cloud
seeding
program
60
due
to
the
arid
desert
climate
and
high
temperatures

allegations

the

s
national
centre
of
meteorology
ncm
said
the
institution
did
not
conduct
any
seeding
operations
during
this
event
62
other
news
commentators
have
also
dismissed
the
link
to
cloud
seeding
stating
that
the
technology
marginally
increases
rainfall
and
that
the
uae
s
cloud
seeding
program
is
localised
to
the
eastern
part
of
the
country
away
from
densely
populated
metropolitan
areas
other
experts
such
as
the
royal
meteorological
society
stated
that
cloud
seeding
would
only
have
a
minimal
effect

with
others
even
stating
that
the
focus
on
cloud
seeding
is
misleading
63
7
scientists
from
the
university
of
reading
whose
cloud
seeding
program
is
used
by
the
uae
denied
that
cloud
seeding
was
to
blame
for
the
heavy
rainfall
given
that
the
large
scale
weather
pattern
was
predicted
in
advance
and
was
too
large
to
be
influenced
by
cloud
seeding
they
added
that
the
effects
of
cloud
seeding
are
typically
short
lived
lasting
for
a
few
hours
