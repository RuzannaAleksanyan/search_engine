the
grammys
had
their
origin
in
the
hollywood
walk
of
fame
project
in
the
1950s
3

as
recording
executives
on
the
walk
of
fame
committee
compiled
a
list
of
significant
recording
industry
people
who
might
qualify
for
a
walk
of
fame
star
they
realized
that
many
leading
people
in
their
business
would
not
earn
a
star
on
hollywood
boulevard
they
determined
to
rectify
this
by
creating
awards
given
by
their
industry
similar
to
the
oscars
and
the
emmys
after
deciding
to
go
forward
with
such
awards
a
question
remained
what
to
call
them
one
working
title
was
the
eddie
to
honor
thomas
edison
the
inventor
of
the
phonograph
eventually
the
name
was
chosen
after
a
mail
in
contest
whereby
approximately
300
contestants
submitted
the
name
grammy
with
the
earliest
postmark
from
contest
winner
jay

of

abbreviated

category
restructuring
edit
on
april
6
2011
the
recording
academy
announced
a
significant
overhaul
of
many
grammy
award
categories
for
2012
43
the
number
of
categories
was
cut
from
109
to
78
the
most
substantial
change
was
eliminating
the
distinction
between
male
and
female
soloists
and
between
collaborations
and
duo
groups
in
various
genre
fields
pop
rock
rhythm
and
blues
r
b
country
and
rap
additionally
several
instrumental
soloist
categories
were
discontinued
recordings
in
these
categories
now
fall
under
general
categories
for
best
solo
performances
in
the
rock
field
the
hard
rock
and
metal
album
categories
were
combined
the
best
rock
instrumental
performance
category
also
was
eliminated
due
to
a
waning
number
of
entries
in
r
b
the
distinction
between
best
contemporary
r
b
album
and
other
r
b
albums
has
been
eliminated
consolidated
into
one
best
r
b
album
category
44
in
rap
the
categories
for
best
rap
soloist
and
best
rap
duo
or
group
have
been
merged
into
the
new
best
rap
performance
category
the
roots
category
had
the
most
eliminations
up
through
2011
there
were
separate
categories
for
regional
american
music
forms
such
as
hawaiian
native
american
and
zydeco
cajun
music
a
consistently
low
number
of
entries
in
these
categories
led
the
recording
academy
to
combine
these
music
variations
into
a
new
best
regional
roots
music
album
including
polka
which
had
lost
its
category
in
2009
45
46
in
same
genre
fields
the
traditional
and
contemporary
blues
categories
and
the
traditional
and
contemporary
folk
categories
each
were
consolidated
into
one
per
genre
due
to
the
number
of
entries
and
the
challenges
in
distinguishing
between
contemporary
and
traditional
blues
and
folk
songs
in
the
world
music
field
the
traditional
and
contemporary
categories
also
were
merged
in
the
classical
field
its
main
category
best
classical
album
was
discontinued
because
most
recipients
in
the
category
had
also
won
in
other
classical
categories
for
the
same
album
classical
recordings
are
now
eligible
for
the
main
album
of
the
year
category
a
few
minor
name
changes
were
also
made
to
better
reflect
the
nature
of
the
separate
categories
the
recording
academy
determined
that
the
word
gospel
in
the
gospel
genre
field
tends
to
connote
images
and
sounds
of
traditional
soul
gospel
to
the
exclusion
of
contemporary
christian
music
ccm
therefore
the
field
and
some
categories
were
renamed
as
gospel
contemporary
christian
music

they
cater

they

they
don

honor

the

roberts
went
on
to
criticize
the
grammy
awards
for
being
mired
in
the
past
and
out
of
touch
with
new

and
trends
among
music
listeners
such
as
music
sharing
stating
77
the
major
nominations
for
the
54th
annual
awards
clearly
show
that
the
recording
academy
has
been
working
overtime
to
be
all
inclusive
but
more
significantly
they
also
reveal
a
deep
chasm
between
its
goals
and
the
listening
habits
of
the
general
population
the
focus
is
still
on
the
old
music
industry
model
of
cash
cow
hits
major
label
investments
and
commercial
radio
in
an
article
for

journalist

also
responded
to
the
snub
and
expressed
general
displeasure
with
the
awards
stating
i
don
t
pretend
to
understand
the
grammys
i
have
never
been
able
to
discern
a
consistent
logic
around
who
gets
nominated
or
who
gets
statues
i
comprehend
the
particular
logic
of
the
oscars
but
not
the
big
awards
for
music
my
normal
state
of
confusion
around
what
drives
grammy
decisions
was
exponentialized
this
week
when
to
the
shock
of
many
kanye
s
masterpiece
my
beautiful
dark
twisted
fantasy
was
not
nominated
for
a
grammy
for
album
of
the
year
78
he
went
on
to
compare
understanding
the
grammy
awards
to
kremlinology
and
commented
on
the
recording
academy
s
exclusion
of
more
mature
hip
hop
albums
as
album
of
the

nominees
noting
that
it
occasionally
opts
to
nominate

hip

albums
instead

after

awards
frontman
justin
vernon
of
indie
band
bon
iver
was
asked
about
the
grammys
and
how
he
would
react
to
a
nomination
for
his
group
to
which
he
responded
79
you
know
i
was
thinking
about
that
a
couple
of
months
ago
someone
asked
me
that
and
i
was
like
i
would
go
and
i
would
and
i
don
t
think
the
bon
iver
record
is
the
kind
of
record
that
would
get
nominated
for
a
grammy
i
would
get
up
there
and
be
like
this
is
for
my
parents
because
they
supported
me
because
i
know
they
would
think
it
would
be
stupid
of
me
not
to
go
up
there
but
i
kinda
felt
like
going
up
there
and
being
like
everyone
should
go
home
this
is
ridiculous
you
should
not
be
doing
this
we
should
not
be
gathering
in
a
big
room
and
looking
at
each
other
and
pretending
that
this
is
important
that
s
what
i
would
say
he
reaffirmed
this
sentiment
and
commented
about
the
grammys
saying
79
ninety
eight
percent
of
the
people
in
that
room
their
art
is
compromised
by
the
fact
that
they
re
thinking
that
and
that
they
re
hoping
to
get
that
award
and
who
is
that
award
given
by
it
s
like
they
think
it
s
literally
handed
down
by
the
musical
history
gods
and
i
don
t
know
who
the
voters
are
like
i
have
a
friend
who
s
a
voter
who
was
like
i
had
to
be
a
voter
because
i
don
t
trust
the
other
voters
and
i
was
like
me
either
and
it
s
just
not
important
and
people
spend
too
much
time
thinking
about
it
bon
iver
subsequently
received
four
nominations
in
november
for
the
54th
grammy
awards
79
after
winning
vernon
said
in
his
acceptance
it
s
really
hard
to
accept
this
award
there
s
so
much
talent
out
here
and
there
s
a
lot
of
talent
that
s
not
here
tonight
it
s
also
hard
to
accept
because
you
know
when
i
started
to
make
songs
i
did
it
for
the
inherent
reward
of
making
songs
so
i
m
a
little
bit
uncomfortable
up
here
80
in

jon

looking

and
wrote
in

to

with
familiarity
over

bestowing

several
more
on

stated

81
in
an
article
for

music
executive
and
author
steve
stoute
criticized
the
recording
academy
and
the
grammy
awards
for
having
lost
touch
with
contemporary
popular
culture
and
noted
two
key
sources
for
it
1
over
zealousness
to
produce
a
popular
show
that
is
at
odds
with
its
own
system
of
voting
and
2
fundamental
disrespect
of
cultural
shifts
as
being
viable
and
artistic
82
stoute
accused
the
academy
of
snubbing
artists
with
more
cultural
impact
citing
respective
losses
by
the
critical
and
commercial
successes
in
eminem
s
the
marshall
mathers
lp
2000
and
kanye
west
s
graduation
2007
in
the
album
of
the
year
category
stoute
asserted
82
as
an
institution
that
celebrates
artistic
works
of
musicians
singers
songwriters
producers
and
technical
specialists
we
have
come
to
expect
that
the
grammys
upholds
all
of
the
values
that
reflect
the
very
best
in
music
that
is
born
from
our
culture
unfortunately
the
awards
show
has
become
a
series
of
hypocrisies
and
contradictions
leaving
me
to
question
why
any
contemporary
popular
artist
would
even
participate
while
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
of
the
artistic
talents
of
steely
dan
or
herbie
hancock
we
must
acknowledge
the
massive
cultural
impact
of
eminem
and
kanye
west
and
how
their
music
is
shaping
influencing
and
defining
the
voice
of
a
generation
it
is
this
same
cultural
impact

and

success

this
came
as
a

the

harvey

85
we
understand
that
the
weeknd
is
disappointed
at
not
being
nominated
i
was
surprised
and
can
empathize
with
what
he

his
music
this
year
was
excellent
and
his
contributions
to
the
music
community
and
broader
world
are
worthy
of
everyone
s
admiration
we
were
thrilled
when
we
found
out
he
would
be
performing
at
the
upcoming
super
bowl
and
we
would
have
loved
to
have
him
also
perform
on
the
grammy
stage
the
weekend
before
unfortunately
every
year
there
are
fewer
nominations
than
the
number
of
deserving
artists
but
as
the
only
peer
voted
music
award
we
will
continue
to
recognize
and
celebrate
excellence
in
music
while
shining
a
light
on
the

that

clear
voting
in

ended
well
before
the

in
no

it

accusations

racial
bias
edit
the
grammys
have
also
been
accused
of
a
racist
bias
against
black
recording
artists
in
a
2017
interview
canadian
artist
drake
accused
the
awards
of
seeing
him
only
as
a
rapper
and
not
as
a
pop
music
artist
due
to
his
previous
work
and
heritage
he
criticized
the
snubbing
of
one
dance
for
the
record
of
the
year
award
and
the
nomination
of
hotline
bling
for
best
rap
song
and
best
rap
sung
performance
despite
it
not
being
a

89
the

the

drake
did
not
attend

awards
ceremony
where
he
was

he
had

on
february
12
2017
the
same
night
as

frank
ocean
was
vocal
about
boycotting
the
same
grammy
awards
and
did
not
submit
his
album
blonde
for
award
consideration
as
a
protest
91
the
grammys
were
also
criticized
after
the
59th
annual
grammy
awards
when
adele
s
25
as
mentioned
above
released
in
late
2015
won
album
of

year
over
beyoncé
s
album
lemonade
released
in
april
2016
which
many
music
publications
believed
should
have
won
the
award
steve
knopper
of
rolling
stone
magazine
believed
that
she
lost
due
to
the
grammy
voters
being
all
white
males
and
for
her
pro
black
performance
during
the
super

also
criticized
beyoncé
s
loss
stating
that
black
artists
have
struggled
to
win
album
of
the
year
they
also
felt
25
won
only
due
to
the
album
s
record
breaking
sales
rather
than
having
cultural
significance
and
the
large
impact
that
lemonade
had
in
2016
93
adele
also
expressed
that
lemonade
should
have
won
over
her
for
album
of
the
year
stating
in
her
acceptance
speech
i
can
t
possibly
accept
this
award
and
i
m
very
humbled
and
i
m
very
grateful
and
gracious
but
my
artist
of
my
life
is
beyoncé
and
this
album
to
me
the
lemonade
album
is
just
so
monumental
beyoncé
it
s
so
monumental
and
so
well
thought
out

so
beautiful

rapper
nicki

spoke
up
against
the
grammy
s
for
allegedly
blackballing
her
after
her
controversial
performance
of
roman
holiday
at
the
54th
annual
grammy
awards
109
minaj
claimed
that
producer
ken
ehrlich
who
had
previously
accepted
the
performance
wanted
her
to
cancel
it
last
minute
due
to
what
he
excused
as
the
passing
of
whitney
houston
minaj
however
refused
his
request
and
performed
anyway
she
accused
that
shortly
after
the
performance
ehrlich
had
snubbed
her
from
winning
the
best
new
artist
category
which
was
awarded
to
bon
iver
in
october
2022
minaj
went
after
the
grammy
s
again
for
snubbing
her
song
super
freaky
girl
from
the
rap
categories
at
the
65th
annual
grammy
awards
and
instead
placing
it
in
the
pop
categories
by
way
of
comparison
minaj
mentioned
latto
s
2021
song
big
energy
being
potentially
considered
for
the
rap
categories
saying
that
if
minaj
s
own
single
is
not
being
qualified
as
a
rap
song
neither
should
be
latto
s
110
she
also
accused
the
grammy
s
of
purposely
placing
her
in
those
categories
to
favor
other
artists
over
her
such
as
adele
and
harry
styles
after
minaj
s
comments
latto
later
responded
to
her
in

series
of
tweets
leading
them
into
a
back
and
forth
argument

subsequently
minaj
s
song
was
not
nominated
for
any
categories
