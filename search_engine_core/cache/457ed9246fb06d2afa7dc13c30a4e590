ghost
voices
for
the
virtual
self
ep
released
through
an
alias
of
the

name
robinson
used
the
early
2000s
as
the
main
source
of
inspiration
for
the
sound
and
visuals

he
said
the
track
was
much
easier
to
produce
when
compared
to
other
songs
on
the
ep
initially
robinson
tried
to
create
a
new
lead
sound
similar
to
the
human
voice
as
well
as
an
ambient
sound
where
it
sounded
like
she
was
going
to
heaven
a
very
beautiful
sad
nostalgic
chord
progression
according
to
him
the
initial
result
sounded
cuter
than
the
released
version
of
ghost
voices
robinson
said
he
was
playing
randomly
with
the
keys
after
making
the
riff
he
noticed
it
was
catchy
which
made
him
write
a
bassline
behind
it
resulting
in
a
sound
he
enjoyed
after
this
robinson
wrote
the
house
styled
drum
pattern
the
first
drop
was
written
from
the
melody
into
the
hook
giving
it
a
dark
mysterious
feel
he
then
focused
on
creating
a
turn
of
century
inspired
trance
styled
break
he
spent
two
or
three
days
editing
the
vocals
from
a
random
demo
he
had
received
a
pop
performance
to
make
it
sound
ghostly
and
ethereal

s
songs
were
described
by

neotrance
strictly
having
a

mid

while

said
it
is
a
slick
sexy
house
tune
bringing
soulful
halftime

has
a
shine
like
dark
velvet
with
fat

philip
sherburne
of
pitchfork
said
that
although
the
song
contains
rushing
snare
rolls
and
classic
reese
bass
its
lithe
vocal
flips
and
slinky
air
make
it
closer
to
the
post
disclosure
era
being
in
turn
the
most
contemporary
sounding
song
on
the
virtual
self
ep

conversely
bein
described
it
as
the
dankest
song
on
the
ep
and
that
its
classic
house
groove
and
futuristic
touches
beckon
you
to
the
dark
side
of
the
dance
floor
