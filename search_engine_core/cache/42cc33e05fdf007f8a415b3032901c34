history
edit
historically
staffordshire
was
divided
into
five
hundreds
cuttlestone
offlow
pirehill
seisdon
and
totmonslow
the
historic
boundaries
of
staffordshire
cover
much
of
what
is
now
the
metropolitan
county
of
west
midlands
an
administrative
county
of
staffordshire
was
set
up
in
1889
under
the
local
government
act
1888
covering
the
county
except
for
the
county
boroughs
of
wolverhampton
walsall
and
west
bromwich
in
the
south
the
area
known
as
the
black
country
and
hanley
in
the
north
the
act
also
saw
the
towns
of
tamworth
partly
in
warwickshire
and
burton
upon
trent
partly
in
derbyshire
united
entirely
in
staffordshire
in
1553
queen
mary
made
lichfield
a
county
corporate
meaning
it
was
administered
separately
from
the
rest
of
staffordshire
it
remained
so
until
1888
handsworth
and
perry
barr
became
part
of
the
county
borough
of
birmingham
and
thus
warwickshire
in
1911
and
1928
respectively
burton
in
the
east
of
the
county
became
a
county
borough
in
1901
and
was
followed
by
smethwick
another
town
in
the
black
country
in
1907
in
1910
the
six
towns
of
the
staffordshire
potteries
including
hanley
became
the
single
county
borough
of
stoke
on
trent
a
significant
boundary
change
occurred
in
1926
when
the
east
of
sedgley
was
transferred
to
worcestershire
to
allow
the
construction
of
the
new
priory
estate
on

purchased

borough
council

a
major
reorganisation
in
the
black
country
in
1966
under
the
recommendation
of
the
local
government
commission
for
england
led
to
the
creation
of
an
area
of
contiguous
county
boroughs
the
county
borough
of
warley
was
formed
by
the
merger
of
the
county
borough
of
smethwick
and
municipal
borough
of
rowley
regis
with
the
worcestershire
borough
of
oldbury
the
resulting
county
borough
was
associated
with
worcestershire
meanwhile
the
county
borough
of
dudley
historically
a
detached
part
of
worcestershire
expanded
and
became
associated
with
staffordshire
instead
this
reorganisation
led
to
the
administrative
county
of
staffordshire
having
a
thin
protrusion
passing
between
the
county
boroughs
to
the
east
and
shropshire
to
the
west
to
form
a
short
border
with
worcestershire
under
the
local

april
1974
the
county
boroughs
