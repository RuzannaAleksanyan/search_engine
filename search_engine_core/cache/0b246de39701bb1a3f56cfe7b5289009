according
to

the

blockade
created
hopelessness
among

mohammad

the
head
of

s
military
wing
the

brigades
said
in
a
recorded
message
on
7
october
that
it
was
in
response
to
what
he
called
the
desecration
of
the
al
aqsa
mosque
and
israel
killing
and
wounding
hundreds
of
palestinians
in
2023
217
he
called
on
palestinians
and
arab
israelis
to
expel
the
occupiers
and
demolish
the
walls
217
218
deif
also
called
on
muslims
everywhere
to
launch
an
attack
219
he
said
in
light
of
the
continuing
crimes
against
our
people
in
light
of
the
orgy
of
occupation
and
its
denial
of
international
laws
and
resolutions
and
in
light
of
american
and
western
sic
support
we
ve
decided
to
put
an
end
to
all
this
so
that
the
enemy
understands
that
he
can
no
longer
revel
without
being
held
to
account
220
221
the
long
term
goals
of
hamas
are
disputed
hamas
has
repeatedly
called
for
the
destruction
of
israel
notably
in
its
1988
charter
222
u
some
commentators
have
argued
that
hamas
is
antisemitic
and
genocidal
223
in
2017
hamas
replaced
its
old
charter
with
a
new
one
that
removed
antisemitic
language
and
stated
that
its
struggle
was
with
zionists
not
jews
224
225
226
227
the
2017
charter
accepts
the
idea
of
a
palestinian
state
based
on
the
1967
borders
228
however
the
new
charter
indicates
that
hamas
will
accept
the
peace
agreements
only
provisionally
without
relinquishing
a
claim
to
the
entirety
of
palestine
nor
recognizing
israel
229
223
the
attack
was
also
seen
as
a
resolution
of
internal
tensions
within
hamas
as
to
whether
the
group
s
main
goal
is
governing
the
gaza
strip
or
fighting
against
israel
230
experts
consider
the
disruption
of
israel
arab
diplomacy
and
the
desire
to
assert
its
presence
as
a
significant
security
and
political
force
likely
motives
231
in
addition
internal
strife
in
israeli
society
caused
by
protests
against
the
judicial
reform
encouraged
hamas
to
go
ahead
with
its
attack
232
233
on
21
january
2024
hamas
released
an
18
page
english
language
document
reiterating
its
previously
stated
rationales
and
framing
the
attack
in
a
wider
context
as
a
struggle
against
colonialism
describing
its
actions
as
a
necessary
step
and
a
normal
response
to
confront
all
israeli
conspiracies
against
the
palestinian
people
234
235
it
said
that
maybe
some
faults
happened
during
the
attacks
due
to
the
rapid
collapse
of
the
israeli
security
and
military
system
and
the
chaos
caused
along
the
border
areas
with
gaza
and
that
if
there
was
any
case
of
targeting
civilians
it
happened
accidentally
236
234
the
timing
of
the
release
raised
questions
sources
in
gaza
including
those
aligned
with
hamas
told
haaretz
that
the
document
was
designed
to
contend
with
criticism
of
the
heavy
price
gazans
have
paid
for
the

2023
when
naftali
bennett
and
later
yair

took

239
the
netanyahu
government
has
been
criticized
for
having
championed
a
policy
of
empowering
the
hamas
government
in
gaza
by
for
instance
granting
work
permits
to
gazan
residents
facilitating
the
transfer
of
funds
to
hamas
and
maintaining
relative
calm
240
241
242
by
the
conclusion
of

s
fifth
government
in

the
issuance
of

to
gazans
reached
approximately
2
000
3
000
later
under

this
number
significantly
increased

10

since
netanyahu
s
return
to
power
in
2023
the
number
rose
again
to
20
000
240
these
workers
were
accused
of
spying
on

and
being
complicit
in
the
october

attack
243
244
245
after
the
attack
the
israeli
war
cabinet
granted
additional
8
000
work
permits
to
west
bank
residents
despite
concerns
about
their
vetting
and
potential

risks
243
in

to
granting

permits
millions

while
israeli
officials
were
aware
that
hamas
might
divert
the
funds
to
acquire
weapons
and
rockets
246
241
these
strategies
towards
hamas
have
been
criticized
as
having
backfired
in
light
of
the
attacks
on
7
october
2023
242
critics
including
human
rights
activists
and
aid
organizations
cautioned
that
such
policies
may
have
strengthened
hamas
s
power
in
gaza
while
weakening
mahmoud
abbas
of
the
palestinian
authority
in
the
west
bank
thus
sabotaging
a
two
state
solution
247
242
this
criticism
has
been
echoed
by
several
israeli
officials
including
former
prime
minister
ehud
barak
and
former
head
of
the
shin
bet
internal
security
service
yuval
diskin
247
the
palestinian
authority
and
saudi
arabia
were
also
critical
of
netanyahu

allowing
qatar
to
deliver
suitcases
of
money
to
hamas
247
in
exchange
for
maintaining
the

netanyahu
s
strategy
towards
the
palestinian
issue
has
been
described
as
that
of
divide

palestinian

of

by

despite
israel
exercising
extensive
monitoring
over

furthermore
the

government
of
the

an

274
israel
denied

the

statement
was

who
said
warnings
were
made
three
days
before
the

276
according
to
the
new
york
times
israeli
officials
had
obtained
detailed
attack
plans
more
than
a
year
prior
to
the
actual
attack
the
document
described
operational
plans
and
targets
including
the
size
and
location
of
israeli
forces
and
raised
questions
in
israel
as
to
how
hamas
was
able
to
learn
these
details
the
document
provided
a
plan
that
included
a
large
scale
rocket
assault
prior
to
an
invasion
drones
to
knock
out
the
surveillance
cameras
and
gun
turrets
that
israel
has
deployed
along

and

the

reported
that

followed
the
blueprint
with
shocking
precision
according
to
the
times
the
document
was
circulating
among
the
israeli
military
and
intelligence
leadership
who
largely
dismissed
the
plan
as
being
beyond
hamas
s
capabilities
though
it
was
unclear
if
the
political
leadership
was
informed
in
july
2023
a
member
of

intelligence
unit
alerted
her
superiors
that

an

colonel
ignored
her
concerns
148
according
to
the
financial
times
alerts
from
the

unit
were
ignored
because
they
came
from

contradicted
the
belief
that
hamas
was
contained
by
israel
s
blockade
of

830
on

sometimes

it

the
algerian
representative
emphasized
that

is
not
a
viable
option
862
863
on
22
march
2024
the
united
states
put
forward
a
draft
resolution
that
stated
the
imperative
for
an
immediate
and
sustained
ceasefire
facilitating
aid
delivery
and
supporting
ongoing
talks
between
israel
and
hamas
linked
to
the
release
of

it
was
vetoed
by

china
with

also
voting
against
it
the
resolution
was
supported
by
11
other
council
members
guyana
abstained
864
865
a
key
point
of
criticism
was
the
draft
s
unusual
language
russia
and
china
said
it
was
not
a
straightforward
call
or
demand
to
halt
hostilities
and
implied
the
ceasefire
would
be
conditional
on
a
release
of
all
hostages
865
866
critics
argued
this
would
leave
innocent
civilians
exposed
to
continued
israeli
attacks
until
hamas
and
israel
agreed
a
hostage
deal
865
867
another
point
of
criticism
was
that
the
final
draft
no
longer
contained
clear
opposition
to
a
ground
offensive
in
rafah
866
while
the
original
draft
said
israel
s
offensive
in
rafah
should
not
proceed
under
current
circumstances
the
version
presented
for
the
vote
only
expressed
concern
that
a
ground
offensive
into
rafah
would
result
in
further
harm
to
civilians
and
their
further
displacement
potentially
into
neighboring
countries
and
would
have
serious
implications
for
regional
peace
and
security
866
china
criticized
this
backtracking
saying
it
would
send
an
utterly
wrong
signal
and
lead
to
severe
consequences
866
on
25

unsc

the
resolution
passed
with
14
votes

the
united

abstaining
us
ambassador
linda

stated
that
the

908
including

909
united

although
the

fellow

supported
by

and
western
leaders
generally
see
israel
as
a

that

the

908

the

arguing
that
the

would
have

up

added
that
viewed
