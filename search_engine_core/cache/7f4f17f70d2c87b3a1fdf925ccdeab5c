form
part
of
the
chevet
in
belgium
they
were
not
introduced
before
the
14th
century
in
some
cases
they
are
of
the
same
size
as
the
other
chapels
of
the
chevet
but
in
others
probably
rebuilt
at
a
later
period
they
became
much
more
important

best
examples

be
found
in
churches
of

renaissance
period
in

was
in
