42
in

the

as

conduit
to
transport
military

industrial
supply
to
the

through
a
pathway
known
historically
as

britain
utilized
the

as

entry
point
for
the
supply
chain
in

to
make
use
of
the
trans

railway
43
the

therefore
became
a

their

the

the

concerns
regarding
the

of
the

subspecies
of
the
collared
kingfishers
were
raised
by
conservationists
over
real

development
by
the
united
arab

and
oman
80
estimates
from
2006
showed
that
only
three
viable

were
available
for
this
ancient

one
located
80
miles
129
km
from

and
two
smaller

80
such
real

expansion
could
prove
devastating
to
this
subspecies
a
un
plan
to
protect
the

as
a
biological

was
ignored
by
the

of

environmental
watchdogs

80
real
estate
development
in
the
persian
gulf
by
the
united

and
oman
also
raised
concerns
that
habitats
of
species
such
as
the
hawksbill

greater

and
booted
warbler
may
be
destroyed
80
81
the
dolphins
that
frequent
the
persian
gulf
in
northern
waters
around
iran
are
also
at
risk
recent
statistics
and
observations
show
that
dolphins
are
at
danger
of
entrapment
in
purse
seine
fishing
nets
and
exposure
to
chemical
pollutants
perhaps
the
most
alarming
sign
is
the
mass
suicides
committed
by
dolphins
off
iran
s
hormozgan
province
which
are
not
well
understood
but
are
suspected
to
be
linked
with
a
deteriorating
marine
environment
from

from

84
of

more

these

are
primarily
rocky
but
there
are
also
a
few
coral

compared
to
the

the
coral
reefs
in
the
persian
gulf
are
relatively
few
and
far
between
85
86
87
this
is
primarily
connected
to
the
influx
of
major
rivers
especially
the
shatt
al
arab
euphrates
and
tigris
which
carry
large
amounts
of
sediment
most

have
been

corals
are
vital
ecosystems
that
support
multitude
of
marine
species
and
whose
health
directly
reflects
the
health
of
the
persian
gulf
recent
years
have
seen
a
drastic
decline
in
the
coral
population
in
the
persian
gulf
partially
owing
to
global
warming
but
mostly
to
irresponsible
dumping
by
arab
states
like
the
uae
and
bahrain
88
construction
garbage
such
as
tires
cement
and
chemical
by

have
found
their
way
to
the
persian
gulf
in
recent
years
aside
from
direct
damage
to
the
coral
the
construction
waste
creates
traps
for
marine
life
in
which
they
are
trapped
and
die
88
the
result
has
been
a
dwindling
population
of
the
coral
and
as
a
result
a
decrease
in
number
of
species
that
rely
on
the
corals
for
their
survival
floraa
great
example
of
this
symbiosis
are
the
mangroves
in
the
persian
gulf
which
require
tidal
flow
and
a
combination
of
fresh
and
salt
water
for
growth
and
act
as
nurseries
for
many
crabs
small
fish
and
insects
these
fish
and
insects
are
the
source
of

of

are
the
most
