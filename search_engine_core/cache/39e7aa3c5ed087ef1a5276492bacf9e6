a
species
description
is
a
formal
scientific
description
of
a
newly
encountered
species
typically
articulated
through
a
scientific
publication
its
purpose
is
to
provide
a
clear
description
of
a
new
species
of
organism
and
explain
how
it
differs
from
species
that
have
been
previously
described
or
related
species
for
a
species
to
be
considered
valid
a
species
description
must
follow
established
guidelines
and
naming
conventions
dictated
by
relevant
nomenclature
codes
these
include
the
international
code
of
zoological
nomenclature
iczn
for
animals
the
international
code
of
nomenclature
for
algae
fungi
and
plants
icn

a
species
description
often
includes
photographs
or
other
illustrations
of
type
material
and
information
regarding
where
this
material
is
deposited
the
publication
in
which
the
species
is
described
gives
the
new
species
a
formal
scientific
name
some
1
9
million
species
have
been
identified
and
described
out
of
some
8
7
million
that
may
actually
exist
1
additionally
millions
more
species
have
gone
extinct
over
the
history
of
life
on
earth
naming
process
edit
a
name
of
a
new
species
becomes
valid
available
in
zoological
terminology
with
the
date
of
publication
of
its
formal
scientific
description
once
the
scientist
has
performed
the
necessary
research
to
determine
that
the
discovered
organism
represents
a
new
species
the
scientific
results
are
summarized
in
a
scientific
manuscript
either
as
part
of
a
book
or
as
a
paper
to
be
submitted
to
a
scientific
journal
a
scientific
species
description
must
fulfill
several
formal
criteria
specified
by
the
nomenclature
codes
e
g
selection
of
at
least
one
type
specimen
these
criteria
are
intended
to
ensure
that
the
species
name
is
clear
and
unambiguous
for
example
the
international
code
of
zoological
nomenclature
states
that
authors
should
exercise
reasonable
care
and
consideration
in
forming
new
names
to
ensure
that
they
are
chosen
with
their
subsequent
users
in
mind
and
that
as
far
as
possible
they
are
appropriate
compact
euphonious
memorable
and
do
not
cause
offence
2
species
names
are
written
in
the
26
letters
of
the
latin
alphabet
but
many
species
names
are
based
on
words
from
other
languages
and
are
latinized
once
the
manuscript
has
been
accepted
for
publication
3
the
new
species
name
is
officially
created
once
a
species
name
has
been
assigned
and
approved
it
can
generally
not
be
changed
except
in
the
case
of
error
for
example
a
species
of
beetle
anophthalmus
hitleri
was
named
by
a
german
collector
after
adolf
hitler
in
1933
when
he
had
recently
become
chancellor
of
germany
4
it
is
not
clear
whether
such
a
dedication
would
be
considered
acceptable
or
appropriate
today
but
the
name
remains
in
use
4
species
names
have
been
chosen
on
many
different
bases
the
most
common
is
a
naming
for
the
species
external
appearance
its
origin
or
the
species
name
is
a
dedication
to
a
certain
person
examples
would
include
a
bat
species
named
for
the
two
stripes
on
its
back
saccopteryx
bilineata
a
frog
named
for
its
bolivian
origin
phyllomedusa
boliviana
and
an
ant
species
dedicated
to
the
actor
harrison
ford
pheidole
harrisonfordi
a
scientific
name
in
honor
of
a
person
or
persons
is
known
as
a
taxonomic
eponym
or
eponymic
patronym
and
matronym
are
the
gendered
terms
for
this

a
number
of
humorous
species
names
also
exist
literary
examples
include
the
genus
name
borogovia
an
extinct
dinosaur
which
is
named
after
the
borogove
a
mythical
character
from
lewis
carroll
s
poem
jabberwocky
a
second
example
macrocarpaea
apparata
a
tall
plant
was
named
after
the
magical
spell
to
apparate
from
the
harry
potter
novels
by
j
k
rowling
as
it
seemed
to
appear
out
of
nowhere
7
in
1975
the
british
naturalist
peter
scott
proposed
the
binomial
name
nessiteras
rhombopteryx
ness
monster
with
diamond
shaped
fin
for
the
loch
ness
monster
it
was
soon
spotted
that
it
was
an
anagram
of
monster
hoax

peter
s
recognizing
benefactors
through
species
naming
edit
species
have
frequently
been
named
by
scientists
in
recognition
of
supporters
and
benefactors
for
example
the
genus
victoria
a
flowering
waterplant
was
named
in
honour
of
queen
victoria
of
great
britain
more
recently
a
species
of
lemur
avahi
cleesei
was
named
after
the
actor
john
cleese
in
recognition
of
his
work
to
publicize
the
plight
of
lemurs
in
madagascar
non
profit
ecological
organizations
may
also
allow
benefactors
to
name
new
species
in
exchange
for
financial
support
for
taxonomic
research
and
nature
conservation
a
german
non
profit
organisation
biopat
patrons
for
biodiversity
has
raised
more
than
450
000
for
research
and
conservation
through
sponsorship
of
over
100
species
using
this
model
8
an
individual
example
of
this
system
is
the
callicebus
aureipalatii
or
monkey
of
the
golden
palace
which
was
named
after
the
golden
palace
casino
in
recognition
of
a
650
000
contribution
to
the
madidi
national
park
in
bolivia
in
2005
9
the
international
code
of
nomenclature
for
algae
fungi
and
plants
discourages
this
practice
somewhat
recommendation

authors
forming
generic
names
should
comply
with
the

history
edit
early
biologists
often
published
entire
volumes
or
multiple
volume
works
of
descriptions
in
an
attempt
to
catalog
all
known
species
these
catalogs
typically
featured
extensive
descriptions
of
each
species
and
were
often
illustrated
upon
reprinting
the
first
of
these
large
catalogs
was
aristotle
s
history
of
animals
published
around
343
bc
aristotle
included
descriptions
of
creatures
mostly
fish
and
invertebrates
in
his
homeland
and
several
mythological
creatures
rumored
to
live
in
far
away
lands
such
as
the
manticore
in
77
ad
pliny
the
elder
dedicated
several
volumes
of
his
natural
history
to
the
description
of
all
life
forms
he
knew
to
exist
he
appears
to
have
read
aristotle
s
work
since
he
writes
about
many
of
the
same
far
away
mythological
creatures
toward
the
end
of
the
12th
century
konungs
skuggsj√°
an
old
norse
philosophical
didactic
work
featured
several
descriptions
of
the
whales
seals
and
monsters
of
the
icelandic
seas
these
descriptions
were
brief
and
often
erroneous
and
they
included
a
description
of
the
mermaid
and
a
rare
island
like
sea
monster
called
hafgufu
the
author
was
hesitant
to
mention
the
beast
known
today
to
be
fictitious
for
fear
of
its
size
but
felt
it
was
important
enough
to
be
included
in
his
descriptions
11
however
the
earliest
recognized
species
authority
is
carl
linnaeus
who
standardized
the
modern
taxonomy
system
beginning
with
his
systema
naturae
in
1735
12
as
the
catalog
of
known
species
was
increasing
rapidly
it
became
impractical
to
maintain
a
single
work
documenting
every
species
publishing
a
paper
documenting
a
single
species
was
much
faster
and
could
be
done
by
scientists
with
less
broadened
scopes
of
study
for
example
a
scientist
who
discovered
a
new
species
of
insect
would
not
need
to
understand
plants
or
frogs
or
even
insects
which
did
not
resemble
the
species
but
would
only
need
to
understand
closely
related
insects
modern
differences
edit
formal
species
descriptions
today
follow
strict
guidelines
set
forth
by
the
codes
of
nomenclature
very
detailed
formal
descriptions
are
made
by
scientists
who
usually
study
the
organism
closely
for
a
considerable
time
a
diagnosis
may
be
used
instead
of
13
or
as
well
as
14
the
description
a
diagnosis
specifies
the
distinction
between
the
new
species
and
other
species
and
it
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
based
on
morphology
15
in
recent
times
new
species
descriptions
have
been
made
without
voucher
specimens
and
this
has
been
controversial
