within
the
italic
league
an
alliance
of
states
that
stabilized
political
conditions
on

as
a
patron
he
is
best
known
for
his
sponsorship
of
artists
such
as
botticelli
and
michelangelo
on
the
foreign
policy
front
lorenzo
manifested
a
clear
plan
to
stem
the
territorial
ambitions
of
pope
sixtus
iv
in
the
name
of
the
balance
of
the
italian
league
of

for
these
reasons
lorenzo
was
the
subject
of
the
pazzi
conspiracy
1478
in
which
his
brother
giuliano
was
assassinated
the
peace
of

lorenzo
s
grandfather
cosimo
de
medici
was
the
first
member
of
the
medici
family
to
lead
the
republic
of
florence
and
run
the
medici
bank
simultaneously
as
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
europe
cosimo
spent
a
very
large
portion
of
his
fortune
on
government
and
philanthropy
for
example
as
a
patron
of
the
arts
and
financier
of
public
works
7
lorenzo
s
father
piero
di
cosimo
de
medici
was
equally
at
the
centre
of
florentine
civic
life
chiefly
as
an
art
patron
and
collector
while
lorenzo
s
uncle
giovanni
di
cosimo
de
medici
took
care
of
the
family
s
business
interests
lorenzo
s
mother
lucrezia
tornabuoni
was
a
writer
of
sonnets
and
a
friend
to
poets
and
philosophers
of
the
medici
academy
8
she
became
her
son
s
advisor
after
the
deaths
of
his
father
and
uncle
7
lorenzo
considered
the
most
promising
of
the
five
children
of
piero
and
lucrezia
was
tutored
by
a
diplomat
and
bishop
gentile
de
becchi
and
the
humanist
philosopher
marsilio
ficino
9
and
he
was
trained
in
greek
by
john
argyropoulos
10
with
his
brother
giuliano
he
participated
in
jousting
hawking
hunting
and
horse
breeding
for
the
palio
a
horse
race
in
siena
in
1469
aged
20
he
won
first
prize
in
a
jousting
tournament
sponsored
by
the
medici
the
joust
was
the
subject
of
a
poem
written
by
luigi
pulci
11
niccolò
machiavelli
also
wrote
of
the
occasion
perhaps
sarcastically
that
he
won
not
by
way
of
favour
but
by
his
own
valour
and
skill
in
arms
12
he
carried
a
banner
painted
by
verrocchio
and
his
horse
was
named
morello
di
vento
13
14
piero
sent
lorenzo
on
many
important
diplomatic
missions
when
he
was
still
a
youth
including
trips
to
rome
to
meet
the
pope
and
other
important
religious
and
political
figures
15
lorenzo
was
described
as
rather
plain
of
appearance
and
of
average
height
having
a
broad
frame
and
short
legs
dark
hair
and
eyes
a
squashed
nose
short
sighted
eyes
and
a
harsh
voice
giuliano
on
the
other
hand
was
regarded
as
handsome
and
a
golden
boy
and
was
used
as
a
model
by
botticelli
in
his
painting
of
mars
and
venus
16
even
lorenzo
s
close
friend
niccolo
valori
described
him
as
homely
saying
nature
had
been
a
stepmother
to
him
in
regards
to
his
personal
appearance
although
she
had
acted
as
a
loving
mother
in
all
things
concocted
with
the
mind
his
complexion
was
dark
and
although
his
face
was
not
handsome
it
was
so
full
of
dignity
as
to
compel
respect
17
politics
edit
lorenzo
groomed
for
power
assumed
a
leading
role
in
the
state
upon
the
death
of
his
father
in
1469
when
he
was
20
already
drained
by
his
grandfather
s
building
projects
and
constantly
stressed
by
mismanagement
wars
and
political
expenses
the
assets
of
the
medici
bank
reduced
seriously
during
the
course
of
lorenzo
s
lifetime
18
lorenzo
like
his
grandfather
father
and
son
ruled
florence
indirectly
through
surrogates
in
the
city
councils
by
means
of
payoffs
and
strategic
marriages
until
1490
19
20
rival
florentine
families
inevitably
harboured
resentments
over
the
medicis
dominance
and
enemies
of
the
medici
remained
a
factor
in
florentine
life
long
after
lorenzo
s
passing
19
the
most
notable
of
the
rival
families
was
the
pazzi
who
nearly
brought
lorenzo
s
reign
to
an
end
21
on
sunday
26
april
1478
in
an
incident
known
as
the
pazzi
conspiracy
a
group
headed
by
girolamo
riario
francesco
de
pazzi
and
francesco
salviati
the
archbishop
of
pisa
attacked
lorenzo
and
his
brother
and
co
ruler
giuliano
in
the
cathedral
of
santa
maria
del
fiore
in
an
attempt
to
seize
control
of
the
florentine
government
22
salviati
acted
with
the
blessing
of
his
patron
pope
sixtus
iv
giuliano
was
killed
brutally
stabbed
to
death
but
lorenzo
escaped
with
only
a
minor
wound
to
the
neck
having
been
defended
by
the
poet
poliziano
23
and
the
banker
francesco
nori
the
latter
of
whom
was
killed
in
the
attack
24
news
of
the
conspiracy
spread
throughout
florence
and
it
was
brutally
put
down
by
the
populace
through
such
measures
as
the
lynching
of
the
archbishop
of
pisa
and
members
of
the
pazzi
family
who
were
involved
in
the
conspiracy
21
in
the
aftermath
of
the
pazzi
conspiracy
and
the
punishment
of
supporters
of
pope
sixtus
iv
the
medici
and
florence
earned
the
wrath
of
the
holy
see
which
seized
all
the
medici
assets
that
sixtus
could
find
excommunicated
lorenzo
and
the
entire
government
of
florence
and
ultimately
put
the
entire
florentine
city
state
under
interdict
25
when
these
moves
had
little
effect
sixtus
formed
a
military
alliance
with
king
ferdinand
i
of
naples
whose
son
alfonso
duke
of
calabria
led
an
invasion
of
the
florentine
republic
still
ruled
by
lorenzo
26
lorenzo
rallied
the
citizens
however
with
little
support
from
the
traditional
medici
allies
in
bologna
and
milan
21
the
war
dragged
on
and
only
diplomacy
by
lorenzo
who
personally
traveled
to
naples
and
became
a
prisoner
of
the
king
for
several
months
ultimately
resolved
the
crisis
that
success
enabled
lorenzo
to
secure
constitutional
changes
within
the
government
of
the
florentine
republic
that
further
enhanced
his
own
power
19
thereafter
lorenzo
like
his
grandfather
cosimo
de
medici
pursued
a
policy
of
maintaining
peace
balancing
power
between
the
northern
italian
states
and
keeping
major
european
states
such
as
france
and
the
holy
roman
empire
out
of
italy
lorenzo
maintained
good
relations
with
sultan
mehmed
ii
of
the
ottoman
empire
as
the
florentine
maritime
trade
with
the
ottomans
was
a
major
source
of
wealth
for
the
medici
27
efforts
to
acquire
revenue
from
the
mining
of
alum
in
tuscany
unfortunately
marred
lorenzo
s
reputation
alum
had
been
discovered
by
local
citizens
of
volterra
who
turned
to
florence
to
get
backing
to
exploit
this
important
natural
resource
a
key
commodity
in
the
glassmaking
tanning
and
textile
industries
alum
was
available
from
only
a
few
sources
under
the
control
of
the
ottomans
and
monopolized
by
genoa
before
the
discovery
of
alum
sources
in
italy
at
tolfa
first
the
roman
curia
in
1462
and
then
lorenzo
and
the
medici
bank
less
than
a
year
later
got
involved
in
backing
the
mining
operation
with
the
pope
taking
a
two
ducat
commission
for
each
cantar
quintal
of
alum
retrieved
and
ensuring
a
monopoly
against
the
turkish
derived
goods
by
prohibiting
trade
in
alum
with
infidels
28
when
they
realized
the
value
of
the
alum
mine
the
people
of
volterra
wanted
its
revenues
for
their
municipal
funds
rather
than
having
it
enter
the
pockets
of
their
florentine
backers
thus
began
an
insurrection
and
secession
from
florence
which
involved
putting
to
death
several
opposing
citizens
lorenzo
sent
mercenaries
to
suppress
the
revolt
by
force
and
the
mercenaries
ultimately
sacked
the
city
lorenzo
hurried
to
volterra
to
make
amends
but
the
incident
would
remain
a
dark
stain
on
his
record
29

patronage
edit
lorenzo
s
court
included
artists
such
as
piero
and
antonio
del
pollaiuolo
andrea
del
verrocchio
leonardo
da
vinci
sandro
botticelli
domenico
ghirlandaio
and
michelangelo
buonarroti
who
were
instrumental
in
achieving
the
15th
century
renaissance
although
lorenzo
did
not
commission
many
works
himself
he
helped
these
artists
to
secure
commissions
from
other
patrons
michelangelo
lived
with
lorenzo
and
his
family
for
three
years
dining
at
the
family
table
and
participating
in
discussions
led
by
marsilio
ficino
lorenzo
was
an
artist
and
wrote
poetry
in
his
native
tuscan
in
his
poetry
he
celebrates
life
while
acknowledging
with
melancholy
the
fragility
and
instability
of
the
human
condition
particularly
in
his
later
works
love
feasts
and
light
dominate
his
verse
31
cosimo
had
started
the
collection
of
books
that
became
the
medici
library
also
called
the
laurentian
library
and
lorenzo
expanded
it
lorenzo
s
agents
retrieved
from
the
east
large
numbers
of
classical
works
and
he
employed
a
large
workshop
to
copy
his
books
and
disseminate
their
content
across
europe
he
supported
the
development
of
humanism
through
his
circle
of
scholarly
friends
including
the
philosophers
marsilio
ficino
poliziano
and
giovanni
pico
della
mirandola
32
they
studied
greek
philosophers
and
attempted
to
merge
the
ideas
of
plato
with
christianity
apart
from
a
personal
interest
lorenzo
also
used
the
florentine
milieu
of
fine
arts
for
his
diplomatic
efforts
an
example
includes
the
commission
of
ghirlandaio
botticelli
pietro
perugino
and
cosimo
rosselli
from
rome
to
paint
murals
in
the
sistine
chapel
a
move
that
has
been
interpreted
as
sealing
the
alliance
between
lorenzo
and
pope
sixtus
iv
32
in
1471
lorenzo
calculated
that
his
family
had
spent
some
663
000
florins
about
us
460
million
today
on
charity
buildings
and
taxes
since
1434
he
wrote
i
do
not
regret
this
for
though
many
would
consider
it
better
to
have
a
part
of
that
sum
in
their
purse
i
consider
it
to
have
been
a
great
honour
to
our
state
and
i
think
the
money
was
well
expended
and
i
am
well
pleased
33
from
1479
lorenzo
became
a
permanent
member
of
the
committee
supervising
the
rebuild
of
the
signoria
in
florence
he
created
a
court
of
artists
in
his
sculpture
garden
at
san
marco
which
allowed
him
to
exert
enormous
influence
on
the
selection
of
artists
on
public
projects

death
and
legacy
edit
during
lorenzo
s
tenure
several
branches
of
the
family
bank
collapsed
because
of
bad
loans
and
in
later
years
he
got
into
financial
difficulties
and
resorted
to
misappropriating
trust
and
state
funds
toward
the
end
of
lorenzo
s
life
florence
came
under
the
influence
of
savonarola
who
believed
christians
had
strayed
too
far
into
greco
roman
culture
lorenzo
played
a
role
in
bringing
savonarola
to
florence
40
lorenzo
died
during
the
late
night
of
8
april
1492
at
the
longtime
family

savonarola
visited

deathbed
the
rumour
that
savonarola
damned

on

has
been
refuted

death
report
that
he
died
peacefully
after
listening
to
the
gospel
of
the
day
42
many
signs
and
portents
were
claimed
to
have
taken
place
at
the
moment
of
his
death
including
the
dome
of
florence
cathedral
being
struck
by
lightning
ghosts
appearing
and
the
lions
kept
at
via
leone
fighting
one
another
43
the
signoria
and
councils
of
florence
issued
a
decree
whereas
the
foremost
man
of
all
this
city
the
lately
deceased
lorenzo
de
medici
did
during
his
whole
life
neglect
no
opportunity
of
protecting
increasing
adorning
and
raising
this
city
but
was
always
ready
with
counsel
authority
and
painstaking
in
thought
and
deed
shrank
from
neither
trouble
nor
danger
for
the
good
of
the
state
and
its
freedom
it
has
seemed
good
to
the
senate
and
people
of
florence
to
establish
a
public
testimonial
of
gratitude
to
the
memory
of
such
a
man
in
order
that
virtue
might
not
be
unhonoured
among
florentines
and
that
in
days
to
come
other
citizens
may
be
incited
to
serve
the
commonwealth
with
might
and
wisdom
44
lorenzo
was
buried
with
his
brother
giuliano
in
the
basilica
di
san
lorenzo
in
the
red
porphyry
sarcophagus
designed
for
piero
and
giovanni
de
medici
not
as
might
be
expected
in
the
new
sacristy
designed
by
michelangelo
the
latter
holds
the
two
monumental
tombs
of
lorenzo
and
giuliano
s
less
known
namesakes
lorenzo
duke
of
urbino
and
giuliano
duke
of
nemours
45
according
to
williamson
and
others
the
statues
of
the
lesser
lorenzo
and
giuliano
were
carved
by
michelangelo
to
incorporate
the
essence
of
the
famous
men
in
1559
the
bodies
of
lorenzo
de
medici
the
magnificent
and
his
brother
giuliano
were
interred
in
the
new
sacristy
in
an
unmarked
tomb
beneath
michelangelo
s
statue
of
the
madonna
45
medical
researchers
have
suggested
that
lorenzo
may
have
suffered
from
acromegaly
a
rare
disorder
that
results
from
excessive
secretion
of
growth
hormone
based
on
interpretation
of
his
reported
symptoms
and
later
analysis
of
his
skeleton
and
death
mask
