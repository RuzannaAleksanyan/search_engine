fighting
took
place
throughout
europe
the
middle
east
africa
the

and
parts
of

one
of
the
deadliest
wars
in
history
it
resulted
in
an
estimated
9
million
soldiers
dead
and
23
million
wounded
plus
up
to
8
million
civilian
deaths
from
numerous
causes
including
genocide
the
movement
of
large
numbers
of
troops
and
civilians
during
the

was
a
major
factor
in
spreading
the
1918
spanish
flu
pandemic
increasing
diplomatic
tensions
between
the
european
great
powers
reached
a
breaking
point
on
28
june
1914
when
a
bosnian
serb
named
gavrilo

assassinated
archduke
franz
ferdinand
heir
to
the

throne
austria
hungary
held
serbia
responsible
and
declared
war
on
28

russia
came
to
serbia
s
defence
and
by
4
august
germany
france
and
britain
were
drawn
into
the
war
with
the
ottoman
empire
joining
in
november
of
the
same
year
germany
s
strategy
in
1914
was
to
first
defeat
france
then
transfer
forces
to
the
russian
front
however
this
failed
and
by
the
end
of
1914
the
western
front
consisted
of
a
continuous
line
of
trenches
stretching
from
the
english
channel
to
switzerland
the
eastern
front
was
more
dynamic
but
neither
side
could
gain
a
decisive
advantage
despite
costly
offensives
as
the
war
expanded
to
more
fronts
bulgaria
italy
romania
greece
and
others
joined
in
from
1915
onward
in
early
1917
the
united
states
entered
the
war
on
the
allies
side
and
later
the
same
year
the
bolsheviks
seized
power
in
the
russian
october
revolution
making
peace
with
the
central
powers
in
early
1918
germany
launched
an
offensive
in
the
west
in
march
1918
and
despite
initial
successes
it
left
the
german
army
exhausted
and
demoralised
a
successful
allied
counter
offensive
later
that
year
caused
a
collapse
of
the
german
frontline
by
the
end
of
1918
bulgaria
the
ottoman
empire
and
austria
hungary
agreed
to
armistices
with
the

leaving
germany
isolated

the
fighting
ended
with
the
armistice
of

november
1918
while
the
subsequent
paris
peace
conference
imposed
various
settlements
on
the
defeated
powers
notably
the
treaty
of
versailles
the
dissolution
of
the
russian
german
austro
hungarian
and
ottoman
empires
resulted
in
the
creation
of
new
independent
states
including
poland
finland
czechoslovakia
and
yugoslavia
the
inability
to
manage
post
war
instability
contributed
to
the
outbreak
of

namesthe
first
recorded
use
of
the
term
first
world
war
was
in
september
1914
by
german
biologist
and
philosopher
ernst
haeckel
who
stated
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
course
and
character
of
the
feared
european
war
will
become
the
first
world
war
in

full
sense
of

contemporary
europeans
also
referred
to
it
as
the
war
to
end
war
and
it
was
also
described
as
the
war
to

backgroundpolitical
and
military
alliancesfor
much
of
the
19th
century
the
major
european
powers
maintained
a
tenuous
balance
of
power
known
as
the
concert
of
europe
6
after
1848
this
was
challenged
by
britain
s
withdrawal
into
so
called
splendid
isolation
the
decline
of
the
ottoman
empire
new
imperialism
and
the
rise
of
prussia
under
otto
von
bismarck
the
1866
austro
prussian
war
established
prussian
hegemony
in
german
states
while
victory
in
the
1870
1871
franco
prussian
war
allowed
bismarck
to
consolidate
a
german
empire
under
prussian
leadership
avenging
the
defeat
of
1871
or
revanchism
and
recovering
the
provinces
of
alsace
lorraine
became
an
obsession
of
french
policy
and
public
opinion
for
the
following
few
years
7
yet
since
the
1880s
this
concern
was
eclipsed
by
the
conquest
of
a
vast
colonial
empire
and
had
disappeared
from
the
programs
of
all
french
political
parties
as
utterly
unrealistic
8
to
isolate
france
and
avoid
a
war
on
two
fronts
bismarck
negotiated
the
league
of
the
three
emperors
between
austria
hungary
russia
and
germany
after
russian
victory
in
the
1877
1878
russo
turkish
war
the
league
was
dissolved
due
to
austrian
concerns
over
russian
influence
in
the
balkans
an
area
they
considered
to
be
of
vital
strategic
interest
germany
and
austria
hungary
then
formed
the
1879
dual
alliance
which
became
the
triple
alliance
when
italy
joined
in
1882
9
for
bismarck
the
purpose
of
these
agreements
was
to
isolate
france
by
ensuring
the
three
empires
resolve
any
disputes
between
themselves
when
this
was
threatened
in
1880
by
british
and
french
attempts
to
negotiate
directly
with
russia
he
reformed
the
league
in
1881
which
was
renewed
in
1883
and
1885
after
the
agreement
lapsed
in
1887
he
replaced
it
with
the
reinsurance
treaty
a
secret
agreement
between
germany
and
russia
to
remain
neutral
if
either
were
attacked
by
france
or
austria
hungary
10
bismarck
viewed
peace
with
russia
as
the
foundation
of
german
foreign
policy
but
after
becoming
kaiser
in
1890
wilhelm
ii
forced
him
to
retire
and
was
persuaded
not
to
renew
the
reinsurance
treaty
by
his
new
chancellor
leo
von
caprivi
11
this
provided
france
an
opportunity
to
counteract
the
triple
alliance
by
signing
the
franco
russian
alliance
in
1894
followed
by
the
1904
entente
cordiale
with
britain
the
triple
entente
was
completed
by
the
1907
anglo
russian
convention
while
these
were
not
formal
alliances
by
settling
long
standing
colonial
disputes
in
asia
and
africa
the
notion
of
british
entry
into
any
future
conflict
involving
france
or
russia
became
a
possibility
12
british
and
russian
support
for
france
against
germany
during
the
agadir
crisis
in
1911
reinforced
their
relationship
increasing
anglo
german
estrangement
13
arms
racegerman
industrial
strength
and
production
had
significantly
increased
after
1871
driven
by
the
creation
of
a
unified
reich
french
indemnity
payments
and
the
annexation
of
alsace
lorraine
backed
by
wilhelm
ii
admiral
alfred
von
tirpitz
sought
to
use
this
growth
in
economic
power
to
build
a
kaiserliche
marine
or
imperial
german
navy
which
could
compete
with
the
british
royal
navy
for
naval
supremacy
14
his
thinking
was
influenced
by
us
naval
strategist
alfred
thayer
mahan
who
had
argued
that
possession
of
a
blue
water
navy
was
vital
for
global
power
projection
tirpitz
had
his
books
translated
into
german
while
wilhelm
made
them
required
reading
for
his
advisors
and
senior
military
personnel
15
however
it
was
also
an
emotional
decision
driven
by
wilhelm
s
simultaneous
admiration
for
the
royal
navy
and
desire
to
surpass
it
bismarck
thought
that
the
british
would
not
interfere
in
europe
as
long
as
its
maritime
supremacy
remained
secure
but
his
dismissal
in
1890
led
to
a
change
in
policy
and
an
anglo
german
naval
arms
race
began
16
despite
the
vast
sums
spent
by
tirpitz
the
launch
of
hms
dreadnought
in
1906
gave
the
british
a
technological
advantage
over
their
german
rivals
14
ultimately
the
race
diverted
huge
resources
into
creating
a
german
navy
large
enough
to
antagonise
britain
but
not
defeat
it
in
1911
chancellor
theobald
von
bethmann
hollweg
acknowledged
defeat
leading
to
the
rüstungswende
or
armaments
turning
point
when
he
switched
expenditure
from
the
navy
to
the
army
17
this
decision
was
not
driven
by
a
reduction
in
political
tensions
but
by
german
concern
over
russia
s
quick
recovery
from
its
defeat
in
the
russo
japanese
war
and
subsequent
1905
russian
revolution
that
same
year
economic
reforms
backed
by
french
funding
led
to
a
significant
post
1908
expansion
of
railways
and
transportation
infrastructure
particularly
in
its
western
border
regions
18
since
germany
and
austria
hungary
relied
on
faster
mobilisation
to
compensate
for
their
numerical
inferiority
compared
to
russia
the
threat
posed
by
the
closing
of
this
gap
was
more
important
than
competing
with
the
royal
navy
after
germany
expanded
its
standing
army
by
170
000
troops
in
1913
france
extended
compulsory
military
service
from
two
to
three
years
similar
measures
were
taken
by
the
balkan
powers
and
italy
which
led
to
increased
expenditure
by
the
ottomans
and
austria
hungary
absolute
figures
are
difficult
to
calculate
due
to
differences
in
categorising
expenditure
since
they
often
omit
civilian
infrastructure
projects
like
railways
which
also
had
logistical
importance
and
military
use
it
is
known
however
that
from
1908
to
1913
military
spending
by
the
six
major
european
powers
increased
by
over
50
in
real
terms
19
conflicts
in
the
balkansthe
years
before
1914
were
marked
by
a
series
of
crises
in
the
balkans
as
other
powers
sought
to
benefit
from
the
ottoman
decline
while
pan
slavic
and
orthodox
russia
considered
itself
the
protector
of
serbia
and
other
slav
states
they
preferred
the
strategically
vital
bosporus
straits
to
be
controlled
by
a
weak
ottoman
government
rather
than
an
ambitious
slav
power
like
bulgaria
since
russia
had
its
ambitions
in
northeastern
anatolia
while
their
clients
had
overlapping
claims
in
the
balkans
balancing
these
divided
russian
policy
makers
and
added
to
regional
instability
20
austrian
statesmen
viewed
the
balkans
as
essential
for
the
continued
existence
of
their
empire
and
saw
serbian
expansion
as
a
direct
threat
the
1908
1909
bosnian
crisis
began
when
austria
annexed
the
former
ottoman
territory
of
bosnia
and
herzegovina
which
it
had
occupied
since
1878
timed
to
coincide
with
the
bulgarian
declaration
of
independence
from
the
ottoman
empire
this
unilateral
action
was
denounced
by
the
european
powers
but
accepted
as
there
was
no
consensus
on
how
to
resolve
the
situation
some
historians
see
this
as
a
significant
escalation
ending
any
chance
of
austria
cooperating
with
russia
in
the
balkans
while
also
damaging
diplomatic
relations
between
serbia
and
italy
both
of
whom
had
their
expansionist
ambitions
in
the
region
21
tensions
increased
after
the
1911
1912
italo
turkish
war
demonstrated
ottoman
weakness
and
led
to
the
formation
of
the
balkan
league
an
alliance
of
serbia
bulgaria
montenegro
and
greece
22
the
league
quickly
overran
most
of
the
ottomans
territory
in
the
balkans
during
the
1912
1913
first
balkan
war
much
to
the
surprise
of
outside
observers
23
the
serbian
capture
of
ports
on
the
adriatic
resulted
in
partial
austrian
mobilisation
starting
on
21
november
1912
including
units
along
the
russian
border
in
galicia
in
a
meeting
the
next
day
the
russian
government
decided
not
to
mobilise
in
response
unwilling
to
precipitate
a
war
for
which
they
were
not
as
of
yet
prepared
to
handle
24
the
great
powers
sought
to
re
assert
control
through
the
1913
treaty
of
london
which
had
created
an
independent
albania
while
enlarging
the
territories
of
bulgaria
serbia
montenegro
and
greece
however
disputes
between
the
victors
sparked
the
33
day
second
balkan
war
when
bulgaria
attacked
serbia
and
greece
on
16
june
1913
it
was
defeated
losing
most
of
macedonia
to
serbia
and
greece
and
southern
dobruja
to
romania
25
the
result
was
that
even
countries
which
benefited
from
the
balkan
wars
such
as
serbia
and
greece
felt
cheated
of
their
rightful
gains
while
for
austria
it
demonstrated
the
apparent
indifference
with
which
other
powers
viewed
their
concerns
including
germany
26
this
complex
mix
of
resentment
nationalism
and
insecurity
helps
explain
why
the
pre
1914
balkans
became
known
as
the
powder

this

acting
as
a

force
in

officially
titled

ii
west
it
is
better
known
as
the
schlieffen
plan
after
its
creator
alfred
von
schlieffen
head
of
the
german
general
staff
from
1891
to
1906
rather
than
a
direct
attack
across
their
shared
frontier
the
german
right
wing
would
sweep
through
the
netherlands
and
belgium
then
swing
south
encircling
paris
and
trapping
the
french
army
against
the
swiss
border
schlieffen
estimated
that
this
would
take
six
weeks
after
which
the
german
army
would
transfer
to
the
east
and
defeat
the
russians
66
the
plan
was
substantially
modified
by
his
successor
helmuth
von
moltke
the
younger
under
schlieffen
85
of
german
forces
in
the
west
were
assigned
to
the
right
wing
with
the
remainder
holding
along
the
frontier
by
keeping
his
left
wing
deliberately
weak
he
hoped
to
lure
the
french
into
an
offensive
into
the
lost
provinces
of
alsace
lorraine
which
was
the
strategy
envisaged
by
their
plan
xvii
66
however
moltke
grew
concerned
that
the
french
might
push
too
hard
on
his
left
flank
and
as
the
german
army
increased
in
size
from
1908
to
1914
he
changed
the
allocation
of
forces
between
the
two
wings
from
85
15
to
70
30
67
he
also
considered
dutch
neutrality
essential
for
german
trade
and
cancelled
the
incursion
into
the
netherlands
which
meant
any
delays
in
belgium
threatened
the
viability
of
the
plan
68
historian
richard
holmes
argues
that
these
changes
meant
the
right
wing
was
not
strong
enough
to
achieve
decisive
success
and
thus
led
to
unrealistic
goals
and
timings
69
the
initial
german
advance
in
the
west
was
very
successful
and
by
the
end
of
august
the
allied
left
which
included
the
british
expeditionary
force
bef
was
in
full
retreat
at
the
same
time
the
french
offensive
in
alsace
lorraine
was
a
disastrous
failure
with
casualties
exceeding
260
000
including
27
000
killed
on
22
august
during
the
battle
of
the

70
german
planning
provided
broad
strategic
instructions
while
allowing
army
commanders
considerable
freedom
in
carrying
them
out
at
the
front
this
worked
well
in
1866
and
1870
but
in
1914
von
kluck
used
this
freedom
to
disobey
orders
opening
a
gap
between
the
german
armies
as
they
closed
on
paris
71
the
french
army
reinforced
by
the
british
expeditionary
corps
seized
this
opportunity
to
counter
attack
and
pushed
the
german
army
40
to
80
km
back
both
armies
were
then
so
exhausted
that
no
decisive
move
could
be
implemented
so
they
settled
in
trenches
with
the
vain
hope
of
breaking
through
as
soon
as
they
could
build
local
superiority

to
its
advantage

policy
continued
post

by
instigating

in

urged

to

fears
of
a
revolt
in

the
outbreak
of

saw
a
reduction
in
nationalist
activity
79
80
this
was
largely
because
leaders
from
the
indian
national

and
other
groups
believed

would
hasten

by

for

the

these
were

war
and
one
of
the
largest
in
history
the
clash
was
indecisive
though
the
germans
inflicted
more
damage
than
they
received

100
the
nature
of
submarine
warfare
meant
that
attacks
often
came
without
warning
giving
the
crews
of
the
merchant
ships
little
hope
of
survival
100
101
the

launched
a
protest
and
germany
changed
its
rules
of
engagement
after
the
sinking
of
the
passenger
ship
rms
lusitania
in
1915
germany
promised
not
to
target
passenger
liners
while
britain
armed
its
merchant
ships
placing
them
beyond
the
protection
of
the
cruiser
rules
which
demanded
warning
and
movement
of
crews
to
a
place
of
safety
a
standard
that
lifeboats
did
not
meet
102
finally
in

1917
germany
adopted
a
policy
of
unrestricted
submarine
warfare
realising
the
americans
would
eventually
enter

100
103
germany
sought
to
strangle
allied
sea
lanes
before
the

could
transport
a

army
overseas
but
after
initial
successes
eventually
failed
to
do
so
100
the
u
boat
threat
lessened
in
1917
when
merchant
ships
began
travelling
in
convoys
escorted
by
destroyers
this
tactic
made
it
difficult
for
u
boats
to
find
targets
which
significantly
lessened
losses
after
the
hydrophone
and
depth
charges
were
introduced
destroyers
could
potentially
successfully
attack
a
submerged
submarine
convoys
slowed
the
flow
of
supplies
since
ships
had
to
wait
as
convoys
were
assembled
the
solution
was
an
extensive
program
of
building
new
freighters
troopships
were
too
fast
for
the
submarines
and
did
not
travel
the
north

in

a

was
so
controversial
that
subsequent
governments
denied
its
existence
and
the

were
only
made

129
this
arose
from

their

the

174
much
to

article

of

the
so
called

guilt
clause
stated
germany
accepted
responsibility
for
all
the
loss
and
damage
to
which
the
allied
and
associated
governments
and
their
nationals
have
been
subjected
as
a
consequence
of
the
war
imposed
upon
them
by
the
aggression
of
germany
and
her
allies
289
it
was
worded
as
such
to
lay
a
legal
basis
for
reparations
and
a
similar
clause
was
inserted
in
the
treaties
with
austria
and
hungary
however
neither
of
them
interpreted
it
as
an
admission
of
war
guilt
290
in
1921
the
total
reparation
sum
was
placed
at
132
billion
gold
marks
however
allied
experts
knew
that
germany
could
not
pay
this
sum
the
total
sum
was
divided
into
three
categories
with
the
third
being
deliberately
designed
to
be
chimerical
and
its
primary
function
was
to
mislead
public
opinion
into
believing
the
total
sum
was
being
maintained
291
thus
50
billion
gold
marks
12
5
billion
dollars
represented
the
actual
allied
assessment
of
german
capacity
to
pay
and
therefore
represented
the
total
german
reparations
figure
that
had
to
be
paid
291
this
figure
could
be
paid
in
cash
or
in
kind
coal
timber
chemical
dyes
etc
in
addition
some
of
the
territory
lost
via
the
treaty
of
versailles
was
credited
towards
the
reparation
figure
as
were
other
acts
such
as
helping
to
restore
the
library
of
louvain
292
by
1929
the
great
depression
arrived
causing
political
chaos
throughout
the
world
293
in
1932
the
payment
of
reparations
was
suspended
by
the
international
community
by
which
point
germany
had
paid
only
the
equivalent
of
20
598
billion
gold
marks
in

one

nationalist
supporters
of

was

liberal
party
under

leadership
of
paolo

promoted
intervention
in

on

and
used
the
dante
alighieri
society
to
promote

nationalism
312
italian
socialists
were
divided
on
whether
to
support
the

or
oppose
it
some
were
militant
supporters
of
the

including
benito
mussolini

313
however
the
