the
technical
and

infrastructure
to

world
10
the
foundation
does
not
write
or
curate
any
of
the
content
on
the
wikis
itself
11
instead
this
is
done
by
volunteers
who
work
as
editors
such
as
the
wikipedians
who
create
and
maintain
wikipedia
however
the
foundation
does
collaborate
with
a
network
of
individual
volunteers
and
affiliated
organizations
such
as
wikimedia
chapters
thematic
organizations
user
groups
and
other
partners
the
wikimedia
foundation
promises
in

historyjimmy
wales
and
larry
sanger
founded
wikipedia
in
2001
as
a
feeder
project
to
supplement
nupedia
the
project
was
originally
funded
by
bomis
wales
s
for
profit
business
and
edited
by
a
rapidly
growing
community
of
volunteer
editors
the
early
community
discussed
a
variety
of
ways
to
support
the
ongoing
costs
of
upkeep
and
was
broadly
opposed
to
running
ads
on
the
site
14
so
the
idea
of
setting
up
a
charitable
foundation
gained
prominence
15
that
addressed
an
open
question
of
what
entity
should
hold
onto
trademarks
for
the
project
the
name
wikimedia
a
compound
of
wiki
and
media
was
coined
by
american
author
sheldon
rampton
in
a
post
to
the
english
wikipedia
mailing
list
in
march
2003

three
months
after
wiktionary

subsets
of

there
were
discussions
about

the

23
on

11
2006
the
foundation
s
board
noted
that
it
could
not
become
a
membership
organization
as
initially
planned
but
not
implemented
due
to
an
inability
to
meet
the
registration
requirements
of
florida
statutory
law
the
bylaws
were
accordingly
amended
to
remove
all
references
to
membership
rights
and
activities
24
in
2007
the
foundation
decided
to
move
its
headquarters
from
florida
to
the
san
francisco
bay
area
considerations
cited
for
choosing
san
francisco
were
proximity
to
like
minded
organizations
and
potential
partners
a
better
talent
pool
as
well
as
cheaper
and
more
convenient
international
travel
25

the
move
was
completed
by

into
a
headquarters

reasons

in

prior
the

seasons
had
been
a
cause

59
in

wikimedia
foundation
started
looking
for
a
second
facility
that
would
be
used
side
by
side
with
the
main
facility
in
ashburn
citing
reasons
of
redundancy
e
g
emergency
fallback
and
to
prepare
for
simultaneous
multi
datacenter
service
60
61
this
followed
a
year
in

cut
caused

to
be
unavailable
for

in

2012

the

stable
since

as
of
november
2015
the

in

hosts

during
the
2015
fundraising
campaign
some
members
of
the
community
voiced
their
concerns
about
the
fundraising
banners
they
argued
that
they
were
obtrusive
and
could
deceive
potential
donors
by
giving
the
impression
that
wikipedia
had
immediate
financial
problems
which
was
not
true
the
wikimedia
foundation
vowed
to
improve
wording
on
further
fundraising
campaigns
to
avoid
these
issues
206
despite
this
the
foundation
has
continued
to
come
under
criticism
for
running
campaigns
seemingly
designed
to
make
its
readers
feel
guilty
such
campaigns
have
additionally
been
condemned
for
in
2021
being
run
in
countries
that
had
been
badly
affected
by
the
covid
19
pandemic
such
as
argentina
and
brazil
207
as
well
as
for
sparking
fears
in
india
that
wikipedia
might
be
dying
208
this
is
despite
the
foundation
being
in
ownership
of
vast
money
reserves
in
2021
reaching
its
10
year
goal
of
compiling
a
100
million
endowment
fund
in
only
5
years
207
in

the

produced
a
debate
in
both
the
wikipedian
community
and
the
wider
public
the
author
criticized
the
wikimedia
foundation
for
its
ever
increasing
annual
spending
which
he
argued
could
put
the
project
at
financial
risk
should
an
unexpected
event
happen
the
author
proposed
to
cap
spending
build
up
the
endowment
and
restructure
the
endowment
so
that
wmf
cannot
dip
into
the
principal

a
search

project
initiated
in
2015
by
wmf
to
locate
and
display
verifiable
and
trustworthy
information
on
the
internet
212
the
ke
s
goal
was
to
be

reliant
on
traditional
search
engines
it
was
funded
with
a
250

grant
from
the
knight
foundation
213
some
perceived
the
project
as
a
scandal
mainly
because
it
was
conceived
in
secrecy
and
the
project
proposal
was
even
a
surprise
to
some
staff
in
contrast
with
a
general
culture
of
transparency
in
the
organization
and
on
the
projects
some
of
the
information
available
to
the
community
was
received
through
leaked

jimmy

one
of

emphasized
that

is

this
statement
highlights
the
non

nature
of
the
wikimedia
foundation
wmf
a
non
profit
organization
based
in
california
that
owns
intellectual
property
assets
such
as
the

however
the

in

the
wmf
announced
new

for
its

grants
as
of
last
june
the
wmf
reported
239
million
in
net
assets
it
is
expected
to
raise
174
million
in
revenue
in
the
2023
218
despite
expenses
on
the
foundation
staff
s
salaries
there
s
a
significant
surplus
left
to
manage
these
funds
the
wmf
has
created
an
endowment
composed
of
investments
and
cash
this
is
managed
not
by
the
wmf
but
by
the
tides
foundation
a
charitable
organization
that
channels
funds
to
social
justice
causes
and
campaigns
218
the
endowment
aims
to
grow
this
capital
to
130
4
million
in
the
next
fiscal
year
some
of
these
funds
are
allocated
to
the
knowledge
equity
fund
which
provides
grants
218
however
there
has
been
some
controversy
over
the
administration
of
the
funds
while
the
tides
foundation
has
promised
to
become
a
more
transparent
501
c

organization
to
reveal
how
it
manages
funds
details
on
expenses
and
salaries
are
still
lacking
seven
years
later
218
additionally
the
wmf
s
salary
costs
have
risen
from
7
million
in
2010
11
to
88
million
in
2021

yet
only
2
of

goes
