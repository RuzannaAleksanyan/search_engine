francesco
della
rovere
who
came
from
a
poor
family
in
liguria
was
elected
pope
in
1471
as
sixtus
iv
he
was
both
wealthy
and
powerful
and
at
once
set
about
giving
power
and
wealth
to
his
nephews
of
the
della
rovere
and
riario
families
within
months
of
his
election
he
had
made
giuliano
della
rovere
the
future
pope
julius
ii
and
pietro
riario
both
cardinals
and
bishops
four
other
nephews
were
also
made
cardinals

he
made
giovanni
della
rovere
who
was
not
a
priest
prefect
of
rome
and
arranged
for
him
to
marry
into
the
da
montefeltro
family
dukes
of
urbino
for
girolamo
riario
also
a
layman
and
who
may
in
fact
have
been
his
son
rather
than
his
nephew
he
arranged
to
buy
imola
a
small
town
in
romagna
with
the
aim
of
establishing
a
new
papal
state
in
that
area

imola
lay
on
the
trade
route
between
florence
and
venice
lorenzo
de
medici
had
arranged
in
may
1473
to
buy
it
from
galeazzo
maria
sforza
the
duke
of
milan
for
100
000
fiorini
d
oro
but
sforza
subsequently
agreed
to
sell
it
instead
to
sixtus
for
40
000
ducats
provided
that
his
illegitimate
daughter
caterina
sforza
was
married
to
riario
1

this
purchase
was
to
have
been
financed
by
the
medici
bank
but
lorenzo
refused
causing
a
rift
with
sixtus
and
the
termination
of
the
appointment
of
the
medici
as
bankers
to
the
camera
apostolica

the
pope
negotiated
with
other
bankers
and
a
substantial
part
of
the
cost
was
obtained
from
the
pazzi
bank
3
a
further
source
of
friction
between
lorenzo
and
sixtus
was
the
status
of
the
archbishopric
of
florence
left
vacant
by
the
death
of
pietro
riario
in
1474
lorenzo
managed
to
obtain
the
appointment
of
his
brother
in
law
rinaldo
orsini
it
to
the
post
among
the
possible
candidates
for
the
position
was
francesco
salviati
a
relative
of
the
pazzi
family
and
friend
of
francesco
de
pazzi
who
later
in
1474
was
appointed
archbishop
of
pisa
the
appointment
was
contested
by
the
florentines
on
the
grounds
that
they
had
not
given
their
assent

lorenzo

giuliano

pope
sixtus
was
approached
for
his
support
he
made
a
very
carefully
worded
statement
in
which
he
said
that
in
the
terms
of
his
holy
office
he
was
unable
to
sanction
killing
he
made
it
clear
that
it
would
be
of
great
benefit
to
the
papacy
to
have
the
medici
removed
from
their
position
of
power
in
florence
and
that
he
would
deal
kindly
with
anyone
who
did
this
he
instructed
the
men
to
do
what
they
deemed
necessary
to
achieve
this
aim
and
said
that
he
would
give
them
whatever
support

the
events

conspiracy
affected
the
developments
of
the
medici
regime
in
two
ways
they
convinced
the
supporters
of
the
medici
that
a
greater
concentration
of
political
power
was
desirable
and
they
strengthened
the
hand
of
lorenzo
de
medici
who
had
demonstrated
his
ability

conducting
the
foreign
affairs
of
