celibacy
is
the
requirement
in
certain
religions
that
some
or
all
members
of
the
clergy
be
unmarried
clerical
celibacy
also
requires
abstention
from
deliberately
indulging
in
sexual
thoughts
and
behavior
outside
of
marriage
because
these
impulses
are
regarded
as
sinful
1
vows
of
celibacy
are
generally
required
for
monks
and
nuns
in
christianity
buddhism
hinduism
jainism
and
other
religions
but
often
not
for
other
clergy
within
the
catholic
church
clerical
celibacy
is
mandated
for
all
clergy
in
the
latin
church
except
in
the
permanent
diaconate
2
exceptions
are
sometimes
admitted
for
ordination
to
transitional
diaconate
and
priesthood
on
a
case
by
case
basis
for
married
clergymen
of
other
churches
or
communities
who
become
catholics
but
ordination
of
married
men
to
the
episcopacy
is
excluded
see
personal
ordinariate
clerical
marriage
is
not
allowed
and
therefore
if
those
for
whom
in
some
particular
church
celibacy
is
optional
such
as
permanent
deacons
in
the
latin
church
wish
to
marry
they
must
do
so
before
ordination
eastern
catholic
churches
either
follow
the
same
rules
as
the
latin
church
or
require
celibacy
for
bishops
while
allowing
priestly
ordination
of
married
men
in
the
eastern
orthodox
church
and
oriental
orthodoxy
celibacy
is
the
norm
for
bishops
married
men
may
be
ordained
to
the
priesthood
but
even
married
priests
whose
wives
pre
decease
them
are
not
allowed
to
remarry
after
ordination
similarly
celibacy
is
not
a
requirement
for
ordination
as
a
deacon
and
in
some
oriental
orthodox
churches
deacons
may
marry
after
ordination
for
a
period
in
the
5th
and
early
6th
centuries
the
church
of
the
east
did
not
apply
the
rule
of
celibacy
even
for
ordination
to
the
episcopate
lutheranism
anglicanism
and
nonconformist
protestantism
in
general
do
not
require
celibacy
of
its
clergy
and
allow
or
even
encourage
clerical
marriage
in
the
past
lutheran
deaconesses
in
the
church
of
sweden
took
vows
of
celibacy
poverty
and
ties
to
a
motherhouse
the
vow
of
celibacy
was
made
optional
in

3
meanings
of
celibacy
edit
the
word
celibacy
can
mean
either
the
state
of
being
unmarried
or
sexual
abstinence
especially
because
of
religious
vows
from
sexual
intercourse
4
5
in
the
canon
law
of
the
latin
church
the
word
celibacy
is
used
specifically
in
the
sense
of
being
unmarried
however
for
its
clergy
this
state
of
being
unmarried
is
considered
to
be
a
consequence
of
the
obligation
to
be
completely
and
perpetually
continent
clerics
are
obliged
to
observe
perfect
and
perpetual
continence
for
the
sake
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
therefore
are
bound
to
celibacy
which
is
a
special
gift
of
god
by
which
sacred
ministers
can
adhere
more
easily
to
christ
with
an
undivided
heart
and
are
able
to
dedicate
themselves
more
freely
to
the
service
of
god
and
humanity
permanent
deacons
namely
those
deacons
who
are
not
intended
to
become
priests
are
in
general
exempted
from
this
rule
7
however
married
permanent
deacons
are
not
allowed
to
remarry
after
the
death
of
their
spouse
8
the
catechism
of
the
catholic
church
states
all
the
ordained
ministers
of
the
latin
church
with
the
exception
of
permanent
deacons
are
normally
chosen
from
among
men
of
faith
who
live
a
celibate
life
and
who
intend
to
remain
celibate
for
the
sake
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
called
to
consecrate
themselves
with
undivided
heart
to
the
lord
and
to
the
affairs
of
the
lord
they
give
themselves
entirely
to
god
and
to
men
celibacy
is
a
sign
of
this
new
life
to
the
service
of
which
the
church
s
minister
is
consecrated
accepted
with
a
joyous
heart
celibacy
radiantly
proclaims
the
reign
of
god
in
the
eastern
churches
a
different
discipline
has
been
in
force
for
many
centuries
while
bishops
are
chosen
solely
from
among
celibates
married
men
can
be
ordained
as
deacons
and
priests
this
practice
has
long
been
considered
legitimate
these
priests
exercise
a
fruitful
ministry
within
their
communities
moreover
priestly
celibacy
is
held
in
great
honor
in
the
eastern
churches
and
many
priests
have
freely
chosen
it
for
the
sake
of
the
kingdom
of
god
in
the
east
as
in
the
west
a
man
who
has
already
received
the
sacrament
of
holy
orders
can
no
longer
marry
on
the
granting
of
permission
by
exception
for
the
priestly
ordination
of
married
men
in
the
latin
church
see
rules
below
background
edit
in
some
christian
churches
such
as
the
western
and
some
eastern
sections
of
the
catholic
church
priests
and
bishops
must
as
a
rule
be
unmarried
men
in
others
such
as
the
eastern
orthodox
church
the
churches
of
oriental
orthodoxy
and
some
of
the
eastern
catholic
churches
married
men
may
be
ordained
as
deacons
or
priests
but
may
not
remarry
if
their
wife
dies
and
celibacy
is
required
only
of
bishops
since
celibacy
is
seen
as
a
consequence
of
the
obligation
of
continence
it
implies
abstinence
from
sexual
relationships
the
code
of
canon
law
prescribes
clerics
are
to
behave
with
due
prudence
towards
persons
whose
company
can
endanger
their
obligation
to
observe
continence
or
give
rise
to
scandal
among
the
faithful
10
according
to
jason
berry
of
the
new
york
times
the
requirement
of
celibacy
is
not
dogma
it
is
an
ecclesiastical
law
that
was
adopted
in
the
middle
ages
because
rome
was
worried
that
clerics
children
would
inherit
church
property
and
create
dynasties
11
in
some
christian
churches
a
vow
of
chastity
is
made
by
members
of
religious
orders
or
monastic
communities
along
with
vows
of
poverty
and
obedience
in
order
to
imitate
the
life
of
jesus
of
nazareth
see
also
evangelical
counsels
this
vow
of
chastity
made
by
people
not
all
of
whom
are
clergy
is
different
from
what
is
the
obligation
not
a
vow
of
clerical
continence
and
celibacy
celibacy
for
religious
and
monastics
monks
and
sisters
nuns
and
for
bishops
is
upheld
by
the
catholic
church
and
the
traditions
of
both
eastern
orthodoxy
and
oriental
orthodoxy
bishops
must
be
unmarried
men
or
widowers
a
married
man
cannot
become
a
bishop
in
latin
church
catholicism
and
in
some
eastern
catholic
churches
most
priests
are
celibate

who
were

from
the
lutheran

12
in
most
orthodox
traditions
and
in
some
eastern
catholic
churches
men
who
are
already
married
may
be
ordained
priests
but
priests
may
not
marry
after
ordination
neither
the
catholic
nor
the
orthodox
tradition
considers
the
rule
of
clerical
celibacy
to
be
an
unchangeable
dogma
but
instead
as
a
rule
that
could
be
adjusted
if
the
church
thought
it
appropriate
and
to
which
exceptions
are
admitted
from
the
time
of
the
first
ecumenical
council
the
christian
church
forbids
voluntary
physical
castration

and
the
alleged
self
castration
of
the
theologian
origen
was
used
to
discredit
him
in
the
bible
edit
according
to
the
bible
there
at

two
instances
of
non

then
the
case

more
relevant
than
the
possible

jewish
high

the

peter

the

mark
is
linked
to
babylon
through

the
prophet
ezekiel

such
a
way
peter

this
i

has
a

having

a

kind
to
the
unmarried
and
the
widows
i
say
that
it
is
well
for
them
to
remain
unmarried
as
i
am
but
if
they
are
not
practicing
self
control
they
should
marry
for
it
is
better
to
marry
than
to
be
aflame
with
passion
in
the
same
chapter
paul
who
wrote
that
a
pastor
is
to
be
the
husband
of

40
forbids
abstinence
of

relations

for
a
set

states
that

the

but
the

man
is
anxious
about
worldly
things
how
to

a
locus

used
against
sacerdotal
celibacy
is
the
statement

that
a

should
be
the
husband
of
one
wife
and
one
who
ruleth
well
his
own
house
having
his
children
in
subjection
one
interpretation
of
the
husband
of
one
wife
is
that
the
man
to
be
ordained
could
not
have
been
married
more
than
once
and
that
perfect
continence
total
abstinence
was
expected
from
him
starting
on
the
day
of
his
ordination
45
46
47
48
usually
these
also
conclude
that
because
of
the
exclusion
of
sexual
relations
the
members
of
the
clergy
were
not
entitled
to
marry
after
ordination
another
interpretation
of
the
husband
of
one
wife
was
a
prohibition
of
polygamy
which
was
not
uncommon
in
the
old
testament
king
david
and
king
solomon
for
example
were
polygamists

george
t
dennis
sj
of
catholic
university
of

says
there
is
simply
no
clear
evidence
of
a
general
tradition
or
practice
much
less
of
an
obligation
of
priestly
celibacy
continence
before
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
century
49
peter
fink
sj
agrees
saying
that
underlying
premises
used
in
the
book
apostolic
origins
of
priestly
celibacy
would
not
stand
up
so
comfortably
to
historical
scrutiny
50
dennis
says
this
book
provides
no
evidence
that
celibacy
had
apostolic
origins
49
similarly
philippe
delhaye
wrote
during
the
first
three
or
four
centuries
no
law
was
promulgated
prohibiting
clerical
marriage
celibacy
was
a
matter
of
choice
for
bishops
priests
and
deacons
the
apostolic
constitutions
c
400
excommunicated
a
priest
or
bishop
who
left
his
wife

pretense
of
piety

however
the
19th
century
protestant
historian
philip
schaff
evidences
that
by
the
early
4th
century
priestly
celibacy
continence
was
not
a
novelty
stating
that
all
marriages
contracted
by
clerics
in
holy
orders
were
declared
null
and
void
in
530
by

i
who
also
declared
the
children
of
such
marriages
illegitimate
52
catholic
author
greg
dues
states
that
early
heretics
such
as
manichaeans
and
montanists
added
a
negative
influence
by
proclaiming
that
sexual
expression
including
that
of
the
laity
was
impure
catholic
leaders
such
as
st
augustine
taught
that
original
sin
was
transmitted
through
intercourse
therefore
abstinence
and
virginity
was
the
ideal
life
and
only
the
weak
should
marry
however
most
bishops
and
presbyters
continued
to
marry
in
fact
the
only
marriages
that
had
to
have
any
kind
of
blessing
were
those
of
deacons
and
priests
the
tradition
of
celibacy
continued
to
evolve
in
some
places
it
was
expected
that
priests
be
not
sexually
active
after
ordination
when
monastic
spirituality
became
popular
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
it
promoted
the
ideal
of
celibacy
as
a
model
for
all
priests
one
way
church
authority
enforced
celibacy
was
by

the

is
often
seen
as
the
first
to
issue
a
written
regulation
requiring
clergy
to
abstain
from

intercourse
its
canon
33
decreed
bishops
presbyters

with

are
to

63
it
is
disputed
whether
this

mandated
permanent
continence

only
as
is
the
practice

for
the

periodical
continence

66
in

who
in

a

decreed
that
bishops
priests

abstain
from
conjugal
relations
it
is
fitting
that
the
holy
bishops
and
priests
of
god
as
well
as
the
levites
i
e
those
who
are
in
the
service
of
the
divine
sacraments
observe
perfect
continence
so
that
they
may
obtain
in
all
simplicity
what
they
are
asking
from
god
what
the

taught

what
antiquity
itself
observed
let
us
also

67
the
directa
decretal
of
pope
siricius
385
states
we
have
indeed
discovered
that
many
priests
and
deacons
of
christ
brought
children
into
the
world
either
through
union
with
their
wives
or
through
shameful
intercourse
and
they
used
as
an
excuse
the
fact
that
in
the
old
testament
as
we
can
read
priests
and
ministers
were
permitted
to
beget
children

for

the
greek
ecclesiastical
historians
socrates

sozomen
who
wrote
a
century
after
the
event
reported
that
the
first
council
of
nicaea
325
considered
ordering
all
married
clergy
to
refrain
from
conjugal
relations
but
the
council
was
dissuaded
by
paphnutius
of
thebes
70
according
to
sozomen
s
history
while
the
bishops
at
nicaea
were
deliberating
about
this
some
thought
that
a
law
ought
to
be
passed
enacting
that
bishops
and
presbyters
deacons
and
subdeacons
should
hold
no
intercourse
with
the
wife
they
had
espoused
before
they
entered
the
priesthood
but
paphnutius
the
confessor
stood
up
and
testified
against
this
proposition
he
said
that
marriage
was
honorable
and
chaste
and
that
cohabitation
with
their
own
wives
was
chastity
and
advised
the
synod
not
to
frame
such
a
law
for
it
would
be
difficult
to
bear
and
might
serve
as
an
occasion
of
incontinence
to
them
and
their
wives
and
he
reminded
them
that
according
to
the
ancient
tradition
of
the
church
those
who
were
unmarried
when
they
took
part
in
the
communion
of
sacred
orders
were
required
to
remain
so
but
that
those
who
were
married
were
not
to
put
away
their
wives
such
was
the
advice
of
paphnutius
although
he
was
himself
unmarried
and
in
accordance
with
it
the
synod
concurred
in
his
counsel
enacted
no
law
about
it
but
left
the
matter
to
the
decision
of
individual
judgment
and
not
to
compulsion
71
the
council
of
nicaea
ad
325
decides
in
canon

the
great
synod
has
stringently
forbidden
any
bishop
presbyter
deacon
or
any
one
of
the
clergy
whatever
to
have
a
subintroducta
dwelling
with
him
except
only
a
mother
or
sister
or
aunt
or
such
persons
only
as
are
beyond
all
suspicion
72
the
term
subintroducta
refers
to
an
unmarried
woman
living
in
association
with
a
man
in
a
merely
spiritual
marriage
a
practice
that
seems
to
have
existed
already
in
the
time
of
hermas
in
the
4th
century
such
a
woman
was
also
referred
to
as
an
agapeta
73
74
stefan
heid
has
argued
that
the
pre
nicaean
acceptance
of
that
arrangement
for
clerics
was
an
indication
that
the
clergy
were
expected
to
live
in
continence
even
with
their
wives
75
a
leading
participant
in
the
council
eusebius
of
caesarea
wrote
it
is
fitting
that
those
in
the
priesthood
and
occupied
in
the
service
of
god
should
abstain
after
ordination
from
the
intercourse
of
marriage
76
epiphanius
of
salamis
died
403
accused
the
heretics
whom
he
called
purists
of
mixing
up
everyone
s
duty
they
have
assumed
that
what
is
enjoined
upon
the
priesthood
because
of
the
priesthood
s
preeminence
applies
equally
to
everyone
they
have
heard
the
bishop
must
be
blameless
the
husband
of
one
wife
continent
likewise
the
deacon
and
the
presbyter
but
not
understood
the
limitation
of
the
ordinances
she
god
s
holy
church
does
not
accept
the
husband
of
one
wife
if
he
is
still
co
habiting
with
her
and
fathering
children
she
does
accept
the
abstinent
husband
of
one
wife
or
the
widower
as
a
deacon
presbyter
bishop
and
subdeacon
but
no
other
married
men
particularly
where
the
canons
of
the
church
are
strictly
observed
but
in
some
places
you
will
surely
tell
me
presbyters
deacons
and
sub
deacons
are
still
fathering
children
while
exercising
their
office
this
is
not
canonical
but
is
due
to
men
s
occasional
remissness
of
purpose
and
because
there
is
no
one
to
serve
the
congregation

the
existence
in

in

of

rule
or
at

ideal
of

78
one
of
the
accusations
against
antoninus
bishop
of
ephesus
in
his
trial
before
john
chrysostom
was
that
after
separating
from
his
married
wife
he
had
taken
her
again
79
in
his
note
on
this
phrase
the
translator
herbert
moore
says
according
to
the
apostolic
canons
only
the
lower
orders
of
clergy
were
allowed
to
marry
after
their
appointment
to
office
the
council
in
trullo
ordered
that
a
bishop
s
wife
should
retire
to
a
convent
or
become
a
deaconess
that
of
neo
caesarea
that
if
a
priest
marries
after
ordination
he
must
be
degraded
for
antoninus
to
resume
relations
with
his
wife
was
equivalent
to
marriage
after
ordination
it
was
proposed
at
the
council
of
nicaea
that
married
clergy
should
be
compelled
to
separate
from
their
wives
but
the
proposal
was
rejected
though
it
was
generally
held
that
the
relations
of
bishops
with
their
wives
should
be
those
of
brother
and
sister
the
4th
century
church
fathers
ambrose
and
jerome

that
the
passage
in

did
not
conflict
with
the
discipline
they
knew
whereby
a
married
man
who
became
a
bishop
was
to
abstain
from
sexual
relations
and
not
marry
again
he
speaks
of
having
children
not
of
begetting
them
or
marrying
again
80
he
does
not
say
let
a
bishop
be
chosen
who
marries
one
wife
and
begets
children
but
who
marries
one
wife
and
has
his
children
in
subjection
and
well
disciplined
you
surely
admit
that
he
is
no
bishop
who
during
his
episcopate
begets
children
the
reverse
is
the
case
if
he
be
discovered
he
will
not
be
bound
by
the
ordinary
obligations
of
a
husband
but
will
be
condemned
as
an
adulterer

his

him

preserving

that

he
is
by
no

to

admittance
to
such
a
rank

him

in

contracted
by

who
already
are

regular
monks
and
professed
clerics
and
later
legislation
found
especially
in
the
quinque
compilationes
antiquae
and
the
decretals
of
gregory
ix
continued
to
deal
with
questions
concerning
married
men
who
were
ordained
legally
in
1322
pope
john
xxii
insisted
that
no
one
bound
in
marriage
even
if
unconsummated
could
be
ordained
unless
there
was
full
knowledge
of
the
requirements
of
church
law
if
the
free
consent
of
the
wife
had
not
been
obtained
the
husband
even
if
already
ordained
was
to
be
reunited
with
his
wife
exercise
of
his
ministry
being
barred
accordingly
the
assumption
that
a
wife
might
not
want
to
give
up
her
marital
rights
may
have
been
one
of
the
factors
contributing
to
the
eventual
universal
practice
in
the
latin
church
of
ordaining
only
unmarried
men
100
however
although
the
decrees
of
the
second
council
of
the
lateran
might
still
be
interpreted
in
the
older
sense
of
prohibiting
marriage
only
after
ordination
they
came
to
be
understood
as
absolute
prohibitions
and
while
the
fact
of
being
married
was
formally
made
a
canonical
impediment
to
ordination
in
the
latin
church
only
with
the
1917
code
of
canon
law
101
the
prohibition
of
marriage
for
all
clerics
in
major
orders
began
to
be
taken
simply
for
granted
60
the
second
lateran
council
is
thus
often
cited
as
having
for
the
first
time
introduced
a
general
law
of
celibacy
requiring
ordination
only
of
unmarried
men
somewhat
inaccurately
since
several
of
the
eastern
catholic
churches
allow
married
men
to
be
ordained
though
not
to
be
consecrated
as
bishops
the
new
catholic
encyclopedia
states
the
second
lateran
council
1139
seems
to
have
enacted
the
first
written
law
making
sacred
orders
a
diriment
impediment
to
marriage
for
the
universal
church

and

new
opposition
appeared
in

argued
against
it
in

the

by
then
that

were
ordained
thus
in
the
discussions
that
took
place
no
distinction
was
made
between
clerical
continence
and
clerical
celibacy
the
reformers
made
abolition
of
clerical
continence
and
celibacy
a
key
element
in
their
reform
they
denounced
it
as
opposed
to
the
new
testament

that
a

should
be
the
husband
of

fourth

was
invalid
if
any
one
saith
that
clerics
constituted
in
sacred
orders

regulars
who
have
solemnly
professed
chastity
are
able
to
contract
marriage
and
that
being
contracted
it
is
valid
notwithstanding
the
ecclesiastical
law

that
the
contrary
is
no
thing
else
than
to
condemn

all
who
do
not

that
they
have
the
gift
of
chastity
even
though
they
have
made
a
vow
thereof
may
contract

let
him
be
anathema
seeing
that

refuses
not
that
gift
to
those
who
ask
for
it
rightly
neither
does
he
suffer
us
to
be
tempted
above
that
which
we
are
able

saith

to
be
placed

the
state

that
it

after

i
would

you
to
be

that
is
without

is
solicitous
for
the
things
that
belong
to
the
lord
how
he
may
please
god

he
that
is
with
a
wife
is
solicitous
for
the
things
of
the
world
how
he
may
please
his
wife
and
he
is
divided
and
the
unmarried
woman
and
the
virgin
thinketh
on
the
things
of
the
lord
that
she
may
be
holy
both
in
body
and
spirit
but
she
that
is
married
thinketh
on
the
things
of
this
world
how
she
may
please
her
husband
and
this
i
speak
for
your
profit
not
to
cast
a
snare
upon
you
but
for
that
which
is
decent
and
which
may
give
you
power

attend
upon

is
sometimes
cited
by
those
opposed
to
mandatory
clerical
celibacy
as
the
verse
is
often
rendered
as
referring
to
the
apostles
carrying
wives
with
them
even
apart
from
disputes
about
the
significance
of
the
word
translated
as
wives
116
this
passage
is
of
doubtful
relevance
to
the
rule
of
celibacy
for
priests
of
the
latin
church
which
was
introduced
much
later
and
is
seen
only
as
a
discipline
within
that
particular
church
alone
not
a
doctrine
binding
all

during

in

the
practice
of
clerical
continence
along
with
a
prohibition
of
marriage
after
ordination
as
a
deacon
priest
or
bishop
is
traceable
from
the
time
of
the
council
of
elvira
of
approximately
305
306
this
law
was
reinforced
in
the
directa
decretal
385
and
at
the
council
of
carthage
in
390
the
tradition
of
clerical
continence
developed
into
a
practice
of
clerical
celibacy
ordaining
only
unmarried
men
from
the
11th
century
onward
among
latin
church
catholics
and
became
a
formal
part
of
canon
law
in
1917
117
this
law
of
clerical
celibacy
does
not
apply
to
eastern
catholics
until
recently
the
eastern
catholic
bishops
of
north
america
would
generally
ordain
only
unmarried
men
for
fear
that
married
priests
would
create
scandal
since
vatican
ii
s
call
for
the
restoration
of
eastern
catholic
traditions
a
number
of
bishops
have
returned
to
the
traditional
practice
of
ordaining
married
men
to
the
presbyterate
bishops
are
still
celibate
and
normally
chosen
from
the
ranks
of
ordained
monks
in
the
latin
church
exceptions
are
sometimes
made
after
the
second
vatican
council
a
general
exception
was
made
for
the
ordination
as
deacons
of
men
of
at

thirty
five
years
of
age
who
are
not
intended
to
be

despite

s
historical
practice
of

celibacy
there
have
been
catholic
priests
throughout
the
centuries
who
have
engaged
in

relations
through
the
practice
of
concubinage
122
in
february
2019
the
catholic
church
acknowledged
that
the
church
s
celibacy
policy
has
not
always
been
enforced
and
that
at
some
point
in
history
the
vatican
enacted
secret
rules
to
protect
priests
who
violated
their
vows
of
celibacy
123
124
125
the
rules
even
applied

so
as
well
125

123
some
of
those
who

publicly
came

some
clergy
who
violated
the

policy
which
also
forbids
marriage
for
clergy
who
did
not
convert
from
protestant
faiths
such
as
lutheranism
or
anglicanism
have
also
maintained
their
clerical
status
after
marrying
women
in
secret
one
example
was
shown
in
the
diocese
of
greensburg
in
pennsylvania
where
a
priest
maintained
his
clerical
status
after
he
had
married
a
girl
he
impregnated
126
in
2012
kevin
lee
a
priest
in
australia
revealed
that
he
had
maintained
his
clerical
status
after
he
had
secretly
married
for
a
full
year
and
that
church
leaders
were
aware
of
his
secret
marriage
but
disregarded
the
celibacy
policy
126
127
128
the
same
year
it
was
revealed
that
former
los

auxiliary
bishop
gabino
zavala
had
privately
fathered
two
children
who
were
not
twins

had
more
than
a
passing
relationship
with
their
mother
before
