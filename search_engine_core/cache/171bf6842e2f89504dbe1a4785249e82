the

co
pilot
inadvertently
selected
the

setting
also
known
as
a
to

tells
the
autopilot
to
increase
the
throttles
to
take

the
crew
attempted
to
correct
the
situation
manually
reducing
the
throttles
and
pushing
the
yoke
forward
however
they
did
not
disconnect
the
autopilot
which
was
still
acting
on
the
inadvertent
go
around
command
it
had
been
given
so
it
increased
its
own
efforts
to
overcome
the
action
of
the
pilot
the
autopilot
followed
its
procedures
and
moved
the
horizontal
stabilizer
to
its
full
nose
up
position
the
pilots
realizing
the
landing
must
be
aborted
and
not
understanding
that
the
to
ga
was
still
engaged
then
knowingly
executed
a
manual
go
around
pulling
back
on
the
yoke
and
adding
to
the
nose
up
attitude
that
the
autopilot
was
already
trying

execute
the
aircraft
levelled
off
for
about
15
seconds
and
continued
descending
until
about
500
feet
150
m
where
there
were
two
bursts
of
thrust
applied
in
quick
succession
and
the
aircraft
was
nose
up
in
a
steep
climb
the
resulting
extreme
nose
up
attitude
combined
with
decreasing
relative
airspeed
due
to
insufficient
thrust
resulted
in
an
aerodynamic
stall

investigation
edit
the
crash
which
destroyed
the
aircraft
delivered
less
than
three
years
earlier
in
1991
was
primarily
attributed
to
crew
error
for
their
failure
to
correct
the
controls
as
well
as
the
airspeed
9
seven
months
earlier
airbus
had
advised
its
customers
to
modify
the
air
flight
system
so
it
would
fully
disengage
the
autopilot
when
certain
manual
controls
input
is
applied
on
the
control
wheel
in
go
around
mode
duplication
13
which
would
have
included
the
yoke
forward
movement
the
pilots
made
on
this
accident
flight
the
accident
aircraft
was
scheduled
to
only
receive
the
update
the
next
time
it
required
a
more
substantial
service
break
because
china
airlines
judged
that
the
modifications
were
not
urgent
duplication
13
these
factors
were
deemed
contributing
incidents
to
the
crash
after
the
primary
failure
of
the
pilots
to
take
control
of
the
situation
once
it
began
9
the
investigation
also
revealed
that
the
pilot
had
been
trained
for
the
a300
on
a
flight
simulator
in
bangkok
which
was
not
programmed
with
the
problematic
go
around
behavior
therefore
his
belief
that
pushing
on
the
yoke
would
override
the
automatic
controls
was
appropriate
for
the
configuration
he
had
trained
on
as
well
as
for
the
boeing
747
aircraft
that
he
had
spent
most
of
his
career
flying
14
court
proceedings
edit
japanese
prosecutors
declined
to
pursue
charges
of
professional
negligence
on
the
airline
s
senior
management
as
it
was
difficult
to
call
into
question
the
criminal
responsibility
of
the
four
individuals
because
aptitude
levels
achieved
through
training
at
the
carrier
were
similar
to
those
at
other
airlines
the
pilots
could
not
be
prosecuted
since
they
had
died
in
the
accident
15
a
class
action
suit
was
filed
against
china
airlines
and
airbus
industries
for
compensation
in
december
2003
the
nagoya
district
court
ordered
china
airlines
to
pay
a
combined
5
billion
yen
to
232
people
but
cleared
airbus
of
liability
some
of
the
bereaved
and
survivors
felt
that
the
compensation
was
inadequate
and
a
further
class
action
suit
was
filed
and
ultimately
settled
in
april
2007
when
the
airline
apologized
for
the
accident
and
provided
additional
compensation
