maternal
mortality
in
the
united
states
refers
to
the
death
of
women
specifically
those
who
identify
as
black
or
african
american
during
or
after
child
delivery
1
in
general
maternal
death
can
be
due
to
a
myriad
of
factors
such
as
how
the
nature
of
the
pregnancy
or
the
delivery
itself
but
is
not
associated
with
unintentional
or
secondary
causes
2
in
the
united
states
around
700
women
die
from
pregnancy
related
illnesses
or
complications
per
year
this
number
does
not
include
the
approximately
50
000
women
who
experience
life
threatening
complications
during
childbirth
resulting
in
lifelong
disabilities
and
complications
however
there
are
stark
differences
in
maternal
mortality
rates
for
black
american
women
versus
indigenous
american
alaska
native
and
white
american
women
there
have
been
significant
differences
between
the
maternal
mortality
of
white
women
versus
black
women
throughout
history
in
the
u
s
the
cdc
reported
that
black
women
experience
maternal
mortality
two
to
three
times
higher
than
that
of
white
women
as
of
2021
the
estimated
national
maternal
mortality
rate
in
the
united
states
is
about
32
9
per
100
000
live
births
but
it
is
about
69
9
per
100
000
live
births
for
black
women
3
furthermore
data
from
the
cdc
pregnancy
surveillance
study
shows
that
these
higher
rates
of
black
maternal
mortality
are
due
to
higher
fatality
rates
not
a
higher
number
of
cases
since
the
usual
causes
of
maternal
mortality
are
conditions
that
occur
or
are
exacerbated
during
pregnancy
most
instances
of
maternal
mortality
are
preventable
deaths
4
recently
these
statistics
have
been
receiving
more
recognition
as
researchers
place
more
emphasis
on
minimizing
racial
ethnic
disparities
seen
in
maternal
mortality
5
researchers
have
identified
several
reasons
for
the
black
white
maternal
mortality
disparity
in
the
u
s
including
factors
like
access
to
healthcare
socioeconomic
status
pre

conditions
medical
racism
racial
history
and
access
to
abortion
all
of
which
are
social
determinants

preventative
measures
have
been
taken
at

an
article

describes
that
laws
making

forced
them
into
bearing

for
the

another

describe
how

such
as
black

nerve

racial
bias
edit
in
2020
the
american
public
health
association
declared
structural
racism
a
public
health
crisis
which
was
attributed
to
historical
forces
as
well
as
current
events
28
there
has
been
thousands
of
studies
analyzing
the
racial
bias
against
black
people
in
the
healthcare
system
29
overall
blacks
are
less
likely
to
receive
the
same
quality
care
as
their
white
counterparts
clinician
bias
is
one
of
the
largest
contributors
to
this
disparity
this
bias
can
be
either
implicit
or
explicit
but
both
are
harmful
to
the
well
being
of
black
patients
explicit
biases
have
generally
been
measured
with
self
reports
while
implicit
biases
are
measured
through
validated
tests
of
unconscious
association
29
a
lot
of
empirical
evidence
strongly
suggests
that
white
physicians
hold
negative
implicit
racial
biases
and
negative
explicit
racial
stereotypes
which
causes
them
to
be
influenced
by
these
biases
when
it
comes
to
making
medical
decisions
for
their
patients
in
turn
this
contributes
to
the
racial
inequities
prominent
in
the
healthcare
system
in

americans
are
under
treated

when
compared

30
black
patients
are
less

receive
pain
medication
and
when
they
do
they
are
more
likely
to
receive
a
lower
quantity
than
their
white
counterparts
this
phenomenon
contributes
to
black
maternal
mortality
aiding
in
the
dismissal
of
black
women
s
pain
by
medical
professionals
12
a
harvard
school
of
public
health
publication
discussed
this
phenomenon
by
collecting
numerous
examples
of
medical
professionals
being
dismissive
or
providing
delayed
care
to
black
mothers
expressing
pain
or
problematic
symptoms
31
the
publication
tells
the
story
of
shalon
irving
a
black
woman
who
experienced
symptoms
such
as
high
blood
pressure
blurry
vision
and
hematoma
after
childbirth
however
her
doctors
advised
her
to
not
take
further
action
and
irving
died
soon
after
according
to
the
author
this
was
just
one
instance
of
medical
caregivers
being
less
likely
to
take
black
women
s
concerns
seriously
contributing
to
maternal
death
31
maternal
mortality
is
connected
to
racism
with
black
women
dying
from
medical
issues
that
are
preventable
yet
not
being
listened
to
when
they
complain
about
pain
black
women
are
perceived
to
be
resilient
and
strong
as
a
result
of
persistence
during
societal
and
changes
in
their
personal
lives
and
in
the
face
of
racial
adversity
black
women
have
increased
levels
of
stress
as
a
result
of
this
superwoman
schema

the
risk
still
exists
for
other
black

with
better
resources
for

world
renowned
tennis
athlete
serena
williams
almost
suffered
a
fatality
postpartum
when
she
got
a
pulmonary
embolism
this
was
a
result
of
the
doctors
not
listening
to
her
when
she
expressed
her
health
concerns
and
not
considering
those
concerns
serious
enough
to
be
acted
upon
urgently
34
according
to
a
study
done
by
the
robert
johnson
fund
over
22
of
black
women
report
discrimination
from
medical
professionals
when
they
are
seeking

black
maternal
health
advocate
and
parents
writer
christine
michel
carter
interviewed
vice
president
kamala
harris
as
a
senator
in
2019
harris
reintroduced
the
maternal
care
access
and
reducing
emergencies
care
act
which
aimed
to
address
the
maternal
mortality
disparity
faced
by
women
of
color
by
training
providers
on
recognizing
implicit
racial
bias
and
its
impact
on
care
harris
stated
we
need
to
speak
the
uncomfortable
truth
that
women
and
especially
black
women
are
too
often
not
listened
to
or
taken
seriously
by
the
health
care
system
and
therefore
they
are
denied
the
dignity
that
they
deserve
and
we
need
to
speak
this
truth
because
today
the
united
states
is
1
of
only
13
countries
in
the
world
where
the
rate
of
maternal
mortality
is
worse
than
it
was
25
years
ago
that
risk
is
even
higher
for
black
women
who
are
three
to
four
times
more
likely
than
white
women
to
die
from
pregnancy
related
causes
these
numbers
are
simply
outrageous
abortion
access
edit
unsafe
abortion
is
a
major
contributing
factor
to
maternal
mortality
and
morbidity
and
black
women
who
are
more
likely
to
have
unplanned
pregnancies
and
be
of
lower
socioeconomic
status
are
more
likely
to
undergo
unsafe
abortions
black
women
have
consistently
had
higher
abortion
rates
than
white
women
which
means
that
restrictions
to
safe
abortions
will
disproportionately
affect
them
and
over
the
last
couple
of
years
access
to
safe
abortions
in
the
united
states
has
become
increasingly
restrictive
36
these
restrictions
include
bans
on
particular
methods
of
abortion
care
targeted
restriction
of
abortion
provider
trap
laws
and
specifically
trigger
laws
which
have
banned
abortion
in
some
states
immediately
after
roe
v
wade
was
overturned
in
2022
37
the
lack
of
access
to
safe
abortions
have
been
exacerbated
within
the
past
decades
as
states
pass
strict
regulations
around
abortion
especially
in
southern
states
with
higher
proportions
of
african
americans
the
world
health
organization
recognizes
that
in
order
to
help
decrease
maternal
mortality
access
to
safe
abortions
must
be
increased
and
while
few
studies
have
inquired
as
to
whether
there
is
a
direct
link
between
unsafe
abortion
and
maternal
mortality
the
studies
that
have
been
done
support
this
link
preventative
measures
edit
medical
edit
in
order
to
prevent
maternal
deaths
from
occurring
methods
have
been
identified
which
decrease
maternal
mortality
overall
along
with
the
accompanying
health
disparities
researchers
believe
that
by
improving
the
quality
of
care
within
hospitals
maternal
mortality
would
be
properly
addressed
and
accounted
for
it
has
been
suggested
that
higher
quality
hospitals
that
have
multiple
layers
of
care
such
as
administrative
and
patient
advocates
are
consistent
with
their
collection
of
feedback
from
patients
which
allows
for
further
improvement
in
regards
to
addressing
maternal
mortality
additionally
maternal
health
related
services
such
as
an
intensive
care
unit
24
hour
anesthesia
and
ob
gyn
specialists
contribute
to
the
decrease
of
maternal
mortality
rate
with
the
prioritization
of
standardized
care
and
early
risk
factors
issues
that
may
lead
to
maternal
mortality
in
black
women
such
as
hypertension
hemorrhaging
and
eclampsia
would
be
directly
addressed
38
the
new
study
also
found
that
these
disparities
were
concentrated
in
a
few
causes
of
death
postpartum
cardiomyopathy
heart
failure
and
the
blood
pressure
disorders
preeclampsia
and
eclampsia
were
the
leading
causes
of
maternal
death
in
black
women
with
mortality
rates
five
times
higher
than
in
white
women
pregnant
and
postpartum
black
women
were
also
more
than
twice
as
likely
as
white
women
to
die
from
hemorrhage
or
embolism
blood
vessel
blockage
it
is
also
important
to
recognize
that
only
87
of
black
women
have
health
insurance
and
most
have
gaps
in
coverage
at
some
point
in
their
lives
to
improve
the
health
of
black
women
policies
need
to
be
implemented
that
focus
on
the
expansion
and
maintenance
of
the
care
and
coverage
39
in
addition
to
improving
medical
care
for
black
women
improving
the
living
conditions
of
black
families
would
also
help
to
eliminate
declining
physical
health
conditions
as
the
health
of
communities
has
been
proven
to
link
directly
to
the
overall
health
of
the
individuals
who
live
there
27
some
have
argued
against
the
conventional
classification
of
race
as
a
risk
factor
in
health
instead
calling
for
the
recognition
of
racism
and
poverty
as
the
underlying
factors
contributing
to
black
maternal
mortality
and
other
poor
health
outcomes
for
black
individuals
40
to
address
the
medical
racism
that
exists
within
healthcare
which
ultimately
leads
to
maternal
mortality
many
states
and
cities
have
taken
initiative
by
creating
programs
to
address
the
high
levels
of
black
maternal
mortality
most
notably
in
2018
an
initiative
was
created
in
new
york
city
in
which
healthcare
workers
had
to
undergo
implicit
bias
training
40
in
addition
experts
in
multiple
sectors
such
as
medicine
sociology
and
law
have
said
that
deliberately
addressing
racism
both
within
and
outside
of
the
medical
field
is
necessary
to
decrease
the
rate
of
black
maternal
mortality
according
to
epidemiology
of
racial
ethnic
disparities
in
severe
maternal
morbidity
and
mortality
screenings
are
a
large
component
of
prevention
for
severe
maternal
morbidity
which
directly
correlates
to
the
increase
in
black
mortality
during
pregnancy
as
well
as
access
to
resources
holdt
2017
this
likely
attributes
to
the
also
significant
gap
from
black
to
white
pregnancies
to
be
readmitted
post
pregnancy
using
the
national
nationwide
inpatient
sample
from
the
healthcare
cost
and
utilization
project
from
2012
2014
it
was
discovered
that
black
women
are
found
that
women
were
more
likely
to
be
readmitted
postpartum
to
suffer
severe
maternal
morbidity
and
suffer
life
threatening
complications
aziz

increasing
screening
before

better
maternal
healthcare

maternal

how
