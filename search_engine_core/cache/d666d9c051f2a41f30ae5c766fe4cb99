at

on
the

of
landing

on

from
the
former
president
dwight
eisenhower
and
1964
presidential
candidate
barry
goldwater
president
kennedy
was
able
to
protect
nasa
s
growing
budget
of
which
50
went
directly
to
human
spaceflight
and
it
was
later
estimated
that
at
its
height
5
of
americans
worked
on
some
aspect
of
the
apollo
program
11
to
manage
the
apollo
program
nasa
required
a
more
rigorous
approach
than
it
applied
to
project
mercury
mirroring
the
department
of
defense
s
program
management
concept
using
redundant
systems
in
building
the
first
intercontinental
ballistic

nasa
requested
the

assign
major
general
samuel

phillips
to
the
space
agency
where
he
would
serve
as
the
director
of

the

was
designed

aviation
while
the
apollo
lunar
module
was
designed
and
built
by
grumman
11
to
develop
the
spaceflight
skills
and
equipment
required
for
a

nasa
initiated

the
gemini
capsule
could
hold
two
astronauts
for
flights
of
over
two
weeks
gemini
pioneered
the
use
of
fuel
cells
instead
of
legacy
batteries
and
demonstrated
spacewalks
and
rendezvous
operations
nasa
also
needed
more
detailed
information
about
the
moon
s
geography
and
composition
to
prepare
for
a
landing
using
three
uncrewed
spacecraft
programs
the
ranger
program
was
started
in
the
1950s
as
a
response
to
soviet
lunar
exploration
but
was
generally
considered
to
be
a
failure
the
lunar
orbiter
program
had
greater
success
mapping
the
surface
in
preparation
for
apollo
landings
and
measured
selenography
conducted
meteoroid
detection
and
measured
radiation
levels
the
surveyor
program
conducted
uncrewed
lunar
landings
and
takeoffs
as
well
as
taking
surface
and
regolith
observations
11
despite
the
setback
caused
by
the
apollo

fire
which
killed
three
astronauts
the

was
the

was
one
of
the
most

in

history
marking
the

gave
up
its

in

11
following

nasa
resumed
launching

the

nasa
to
make
dramatic
changes
to
its
astronaut
corps
while
almost
all
previous

were
air

the

allowed
nasa
to
begin
recruiting

a
prime
example
is
sally
ride
who
became
the

despite

where

when

when
a

of
orbital

on

spelled
an

to

11
in

a

during
the

resulting
in
the

this

marked

space

never
gave
up
on
the
idea
of
a
space
station
after
skylab
s
reentry
in
1979
the
agency
began
lobbing
politicians
to
support
building
a
space
station
as
soon
as
the
space
shuttle
began
flying
selling
it
as
an
orbital
laboratory
repair
station
and
a
jumping
off
point
for
lunar
and
mars
missions
nasa
found
a
strong
advocate
in
president
ronald
reagan
who
declared
in
a
1984
speech
america
has
always
been
greatest
when
we
dared
to
be

we

reach

directing

and
to

it
within

in

nasa
proposed
the
space
station
freedom
which
both
the
agency
and
president
reagan
intended
to
be
an
international
program
while
this
would
add
legitimacy
to
the
program
there
were
concerns
within
nasa
that
the
international
component
would
dilute
its
authority
within
the
project
having
never
been
willing
to
work
with
domestic
or
international
partners
as
true
equals
there
was
also
a
concern
with
sharing
sensitive
space
technologies
with
the
europeans
which
had
the
potential
to
dilute
america
s
technical
lead
ultimately
an
international
agreement
to
develop
the
space
station
freedom
program
would
be
signed
with
thirteen
countries
in
1985
including
the
european

agency
member
states
canada
and
japan
11
despite
its
status
as
the
first
international
space
program
the
space
station
freedom
was
controversial
with
much
of
the
debate
centering
on
cost
several
redesigns
to
reduce
cost
were
conducted
in
the
early
1990s
stripping
away
much
of
its
functions
despite
calls
for
congress
to
terminate
the
program
it
continued
in
large
part
because
by
1992
it
had
created
75
000
jobs
across
39
states
by
1993
president

11
in
1993
the
clinton
administration
announced
that
the
space
station
freedom
would
become
the
international
space
station
in
an
agreement
with
the
russian
federation
this
allowed
the
russians
to
maintain
their
space
program
through
an
infusion
of
american
currency
to
maintain
their
status
as
one
of
the
two
premier
space
programs
while
the

built

launched
the

despite
nasa
s
insistence
that

would
be
kept
at
a
budget
of

4
they
kept
rising
and
nasa
had
to
transfer
funds
from
other
programs
to
keep
the
international
space
station
solvent
ultimately
the
total
cost
of
the
station
was
150
billion
with
the
united

paying
for
two
thirds
following
the

nasa
was
forced
to
rely
on
russian

and
the

accelerated
the

in

right
after

nasa
started

with

nasa
realized
that

as

the

cancelled
in

despite
this
it
was
the
first
time
a
commercial
space
company
directly
expended
a
significant
amount
of
its
own
resources
into

development
the
advent
of
space
tourism
also
forced
nasa
to
challenge
its
assumption
that
only
governments
would
have
people
in

the
first

tourist
was
dennis

an

who
contracted
with

to

for
four
days
despite
the
opposition
of
nasa
to
the
idea
11
advocates
of
this
new
commercial
approach
for
nasa
included
former
astronaut
buzz

who
remarked
that
it
would
return
nasa

its
roots
as
a
research
and
development
agency
with
commercial
entities
actually
operating
the
space
systems
having
corporations
take
over

would
also
allow
nasa
to
focus
all
its
efforts
on
deep
space
exploration
and
returning
humans
to
the

and
going
to
mars
embracing
this
approach
nasa

this

the
