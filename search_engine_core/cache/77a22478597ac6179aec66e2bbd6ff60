a

the

inspired

of

had
an
all

brainstorming
session
to
decide
on
building
a
new
application
jack
dorsey
then
an
undergraduate
student
claims
to
have
introduced
the
group
to
the
idea
of
an
individual
using
an
sms
service
to
communicate
with
a
small
group
38
the
original
project
code
name
for
the
service
was
twttr
an
idea
that
williams
later
ascribed
to
noah
glass
39
inspired
by
flickr
and
the
five
character
length
of
american
sms
short
codes
the
decision
was
also
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
the
domain
twitter
com
was
already
in
use
and
it
was
six
months
after
the
launch
of
twttr
that
the
crew
purchased
the
domain
and
changed
the
name
of
the
service
to
twitter
40
the
developers
initially
considered
10958
as
the
service
s
short
code
for
sms
text
messaging
but
later
changed
it
to
40404
for
ease
of
use
and
memorability

dorsey
has
explained
the
origin
of
the
twitter
title
44
we
came
across
the
word
twitter
and
it
was
just
perfect
the
definition
was
a
short
burst
of
inconsequential
information
and
chirps
from
birds
and
that
s
exactly
what
the
product
was
the
first
twitter
prototype
developed
by
dorsey
and
contractor
florian
weber
was
used
as
an
internal
service
for
odeo
employees

version

48
williams
provided
insight
into
the
ambiguity
that
defined
this
early
period
in
a
2013
interview
49
with
twitter
it
wasn
t
clear
what
it
was
they
called
it
a
social
network
they
called
it
microblogging
but
it
was
hard
to
define
because
it
didn
t
replace
anything
there
was
this
path
of
discovery
with
something
like
that
where
over
time
you
figure
out
what
it
is
twitter
actually
changed
from
what
we
thought
it
was
in
the
beginning
which
we
described
as
status
updates
and
a
social
utility
it
is
that
in
part
but
the
insight
we
eventually
came
to
was
twitter
was
really
more
of
an
information
network
than
it
is
a
social
network

musk
began
referring
to
the
platform
as

twitter
119
120
121
and
x
twitter
122
and
renamed
several
features
including
birdwatch
to
community
notes
123
and
quote
tweets
to
quotes
124
on
july
23
2023
musk
confirmed
the
rebrand
which
started
when
the
x
com
domain
formerly
associated
with
paypal
began
redirecting
to
twitter
125
the
logo
was
changed
from
the
bird
to
the
x
the
next
day
126
and
the
platform
s
official
main
and
associated
accounts
also
began
using
the
letter
x
within
their
handles
127
the
x
handle
was
originally
owned
by
photographer
gene
x
hwang
who
registered
it
in
2007
hwang
had
expressed
willingness
to
sell
the
handle
but
received
an
email
on
july
25
2023
stating
that
the
company
was
taking
it
he
was
offered
some
x
merchandise
and
a
meeting
with
the
company
s
leaders
but
no
financial
benefits
128
the
android
app
s
name
and
icon
were
changed
to
x
on
google
play
by
july
27
the
same
change
went
live
on
the
app
store
on
july
31
after

granted
an
exception
to
its
minimum
character
length

129
130
131
around
that
time
some
more
elements
of
the
twitter
branding
were
removed
from
the
web
version
including
tweets
being
renamed
to
posts
132
the
rebrand
was
described
as
unusual
given
that
twitter
s
brand
was
already
strong
internationally
with
words
like
tweet
having
entered
common
language
133
the
rebranding
has
been
criticized
on
the
basis
that
the
trademarkability
of
the
name
and
logo
is
weak
there
are
almost
900
companies
in
the
u
s
that
own
an
x
trademark
134
including
an
existing
social
media
related
logo
owned
by
meta
platforms
135
the
x
logo
uses
a
blackboard
bold

a
character
that

appeared

developer
interest
in
twitter
began
immediately
following
its
launch
prompting
the
company
to
release
the
first
version
of
its
public
api
in
september
2006
300
the
api
quickly
became
iconic
as
a
reference
implementation
for
public
rest
apis
and
is
widely
cited
in
programming
tutorials
301
from
2006
until
2010
twitter
s
developer
platform
experienced
strong
growth
and
a
highly
favorable
reputation
developers
built
upon
the
public
api
to
create
the
first
twitter
mobile
phone
clients
as
well
as
the
first
url
shortener
between
2010
and
2012
however
twitter
made
a
number
of
decisions
that
were
received
unfavorably
by
the
developer
community
302
in
2010
twitter
mandated
that
all
developers
adopt
oauth
authentication
with
just
9
weeks
of
notice
303
later
that
year
twitter
launched
its
own
url
shortener
in
direct
competition
with
some
of
its
most
well
known
third
party
developers
304
and
in
2012
twitter
introduced
stricter
usage
limits
for
its
api
completely
crippling
some
developers
305
306
while
these
moves
successfully
increased
the
stability
and
security
of
the
service
they
were
broadly
perceived
as
hostile
to
developers
causing
them
to
lose
trust
in
the
platform
307
in
july
2020
twitter
released
version
2
0
of
the
public

308
and
began
showcasing

by
third

developers
on
its
twitter
toolbox
section
in
april
2022
309
in
january
2023
twitter
ended
third
party
access
to
its
apis
forcing
all
third

twitter
clients
to
shut
down
310
this
was
controversial
among
the
developer
community
as
many
third

apps
predated
the
company
s
official
apps
and
the
change
was
not
announced
beforehand

that
the

the

twitter
disputed

our

the

however
with
the
simple
nature
of

large

479
much
of
this

comes
from

the

how
