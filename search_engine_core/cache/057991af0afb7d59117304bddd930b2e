the
guild
of
wool

took
over
patronage
for
the
construction

appointed
giotto
to
oversee

major
accomplishment
was

work
resumed

main
competitors
were

master
goldsmiths
lorenzo
ghiberti

filippo
brunelleschi
the
latter
of
whom
was
supported
by

ghiberti
had
been
the
winner
of
a
competition
for
a
pair
of
bronze
doors
for
the
baptistery
in
1401
and
lifelong
competition
between
the
two
remained
sharp
brunelleschi
won
and
received
the
commission
9
ghiberti
appointed
coadjutor
drew
a
salary
equal
to
brunelleschi
s
and
though
neither
was
awarded
the
announced
prize
of
200
florins
was
promised
equal
credit
although
he
spent
most
of
his
time
on
other
projects
when
brunelleschi
became
ill
or
feigned
illness
the
project
was
briefly
in
the
hands
of
ghiberti
but
ghiberti
soon
had
to
admit
that
the
whole
project
was
beyond
him
in
1423
brunelleschi
was
back
in
charge
and
took
over

responsibility

first
day
of

the
statues
was
lifted
into

donatello
made

was
in

created

of
david
by
michelangelo
was
completed
1501
1504
although
it
could
not
be
placed
on
the
buttress
because
of
its
six
ton
weight
in

a
fiberglass
replica
of
david
was
placed
for
one
day
on
the
florence
cathedral
dome
edit
after
a
hundred
years
of
construction
and
by
the
beginning
of
the
15th
century
the
structure
was
still
missing
its
dome
the
basic
features
of
the
dome

been

was
standing

sacrosanct
18
it
called
for
an
octagonal
dome
higher
and
wider
than
any
that
had
ever
been
built
with
no
external
buttresses
to
keep
it
from
spreading
and
falling
under
its
own
weight
19
the
commitment
to
reject
traditional
gothic
buttresses
had
been
made
when
neri
di
fioravanti
s
model
was
chosen
over
a
competing
one
by
giovanni
di
lapo
ghini
20
that
architectural
choice
in
1367
was
one
of
the
first
events
of
the
italian
renaissance
marking
a
break
with
the
medieval
gothic
style
and
a
return
to
the
classic
mediterranean
dome
italian
architects
regarded
gothic
flying
buttresses
as
ugly
makeshifts
furthermore
the
use
of
buttresses
was
forbidden
in
florence
as
the
style
was
favored
by
central
italy
s
traditional
enemies
to
the
north
21
neri
s
model
depicted
a
massive
inner
dome
open
at
the
top
to
admit
light
like
rome
s
pantheon
partly
supported
by
the
inner
dome
but
enclosed
in
a
thinner
outer
shell
to
keep
out
the
weather
it
was
to
stand
on
an
unbuttressed
octagonal
drum
neri
s
dome
would
need
an
internal
defense
against
spreading
hoop
stress
but
none
had
yet
been
designed
the
building
of
such
a
masonry
dome
posed
many
technical
problems
brunelleschi
looked
to
the
great
dome
of
the
pantheon
in
rome
for
solutions
the
dome
of
the
pantheon
is
a
single
shell
of
concrete
the
formula
for
which
had
long
since
been
forgotten
the
pantheon
had
employed
structural
centring
to
support
the
concrete
dome
while
it
cured
22
this
could
not
be
the
solution
in
the
case
of
a
dome
this
size
and
would
put
the
church
out
of
use
for
the
height
and
breadth
of
the
dome
designed
by
neri
starting
52
m
171
ft
above
the
floor
and
spanning
44
m
144
ft
there
was
not
enough
timber
in
tuscany
to
build
the
scaffolding
and
forms
23
brunelleschi
chose
to
follow
such
design
and
employed
a
double
shell
made
of
sandstone
and
marble
brunelleschi
would
have
to
build
the
dome
out
of
brick
due
to
its
light
weight
compared
to
stone
and
being
easier
to
form
and
with
nothing
under
it
during
construction
to
illustrate
his
proposed
structural
plan
he
constructed
a
wooden
and
brick
model
with
the
help
of
donatello
and
nanni
di
banco
a
model
which
is
still
displayed
in
the
museo
dell
opera
del
duomo
the
model
served
as
a
guide
for
the
craftsmen
but
was
intentionally
incomplete
so
as
to
ensure
brunelleschi
s
control
over
the
construction
brunelleschi
s
solutions
were
ingenious
the
spreading
problem
was
solved
by
a
set
of
four
internal
horizontal
stone
and
iron
chains
serving
as
barrel
hoops
embedded
within
the
inner
dome
one
at
the
top
one
at
the
bottom
with
the
remaining
two
evenly
spaced
between
them
a
fifth
chain
made
of
wood
was
placed
between
the
first
and
second
of
the
stone
chains
since
the
dome
was
octagonal
rather
than
round
a
simple
chain
squeezing
the
dome
like
a
barrel
hoop
would
have
put
all
its
pressure
on
the
eight
corners
of
the
dome
the
chains
needed
to
be
rigid
octagons
stiff
enough
to
hold
their
shape
so
as
not
to
deform
the
dome
as
they
held
it
together
19
each
of
brunelleschi
s
stone
chains
was
built
like
an
octagonal
railroad
track
with
parallel
rails
and
cross
ties
all
made
of
sandstone
beams
43
cm
17
in
in
diameter
and
no
more
than
2
3
m
7
5
ft
long
the
rails
were
connected
end
to
end
with
lead
glazed
iron
splices
the
cross
ties
and
rails
were
notched
together
and
then
covered
with
the
bricks
and
mortar
of
the
inner
dome
the
cross
ties
of
the
bottom
chain
can
be
seen
protruding
from
the
drum
at
the
base
of
the
dome
the
others
are
hidden
each
stone
chain
was
supposed
to
be
reinforced
with
a
standard
iron
chain
made
of
interlocking
links
but
a
magnetic
survey
conducted
in
the
1970s
failed
to
detect
any
evidence
of
iron
chains
which
if
they
exist
are
deeply
embedded
in
the
thick
masonry
walls
brunelleschi
also
included
vertical
ribs
set
on
the
corners
of
the
octagon
curving
towards
the
center
point
the
ribs
4
m
13
ft
deep
are
supported
by
16
concealed
ribs
radiating
from
center
24
the
ribs
had
slits
to
take
beams
that
supported
platforms
thus
allowing
the
work
to
progress
upward
without
the
need
for
scaffolding
25
a
circular
masonry
dome
can
be
built
without
supports
called
centering
because
each
course
of
bricks
is
a
horizontal
arch
that
resists
compression
in
florence
the
octagonal
inner
dome
was
thick
enough
for
an
imaginary
circle
to
be
embedded
in
it
at
each
level
a
feature
that
would
hold
the
dome
up
eventually
but
could
not
hold
the
bricks
in
place
while
the
mortar
was
still
wet
brunelleschi
used
a
herringbone
brick
pattern
to
transfer
the
weight
of
the
freshly
laid
bricks
to
the
nearest
vertical
ribs
of
the
non
circular
dome
26
27
28
29
the
outer
dome
was
not
thick
enough
to
contain
embedded
horizontal
circles
being
only
60
cm
2
ft
thick
at
the
base
and
30
cm
1
ft
thick
at
the
top
to
create
such
circles
brunelleschi
thickened
the
outer
dome
at
the
inside
of
its
corners
at
nine
different
elevations
creating
nine
masonry
rings
which
can
be
observed
today
from
the
space
between
the
two
domes
to
counteract
hoop
stress
the
outer
dome
relies
entirely
on
its
attachment
to
the
inner
dome
and
has
no
embedded
chains
30
a
modern
understanding
of
physical
laws
and
the
mathematical
tools
for
calculating
stresses
were
centuries
in
the
future
brunelleschi
like
all
cathedral
builders
had
to
rely
on
intuition
and
whatever
he
could
learn
from
the
large
scale
models
he
built
to
lift
37
000
tons
of
material
including
over
4
million
bricks
he
invented
hoisting
machines
and
lewissons
for
hoisting
large
stones
these
specially
designed
machines
and
his

innovations
were
brunelleschi
s
chief
contribution
to
architecture

was
executing

plan
made
half
a
century
earlier
it
is
his
name
rather
than
neri
s
that
is
commonly
associated
with
the
dome
brunelleschi
s
ability
to
crown
the
dome
with
a
lantern
was
questioned
and
he
had
to
undergo
another
competition
even
though
there
had
been
evidence
that
brunelleschi
had
been
working
on
a
design
for
a
lantern
for
the
upper
part
of
the
dome
the
evidence
is
shown
in
the
curvature
which
was
made
steeper
than
the
original
model
31
he
was
declared
the
winner
over
his
competitors
lorenzo
ghiberti
and
antonio
ciaccheri
his
design
now
on
display
in
the
museum
opera
del
duomo
was
for
an
octagonal
lantern
with
eight
radiating
buttresses
and
eight
high
arched
windows
construction
of
the
lantern
was
begun
a
few
months
before
his
death
in
1446
then
for
15
years
little
progress
was
possible
due
to
alterations
by
several
architects
the
lantern
was
finally
completed
by
brunelleschi
s
friend
michelozzo
in
1461
the
conical
roof
was
crowned
with
a
gilt
copper
ball
and
cross
containing
holy
relics
by
verrocchio
in
1469

on

it
was
replaced
by
an
even
larger
one
two
years
later
the
commission
for

went
to
the

a
young
apprentice
named
leonardo
da
vinci
fascinated
by
filippo

brunelleschi

machines
which
verrocchio
used
to
hoist
the
ball
leonardo
made
a
series
of
sketches
of
them
and
as
a
result
is
often
given
credit
for
their
invention

these

are
considered
zuccari

greatest
work
but
the
quality

is
uneven
because
of
the

astronomical
observations
edit
in
1475
the
italian
astronomer
paolo
dal
pozzo
toscanelli
who
was
also
a
mathematical
tutor
of
brunelleschi
pierced
a
hole
in
the
dome
at
91
05
metres
298
7
ft
above
the
pavement
to
create
a
meridian
line
39
the
height
precluded
the
installation
of
a
complete
meridian
line
on
the
floor
of
the
cathedral
but
allowed
a
short
section
of
approximately
10
metres
33
ft
to
run
between
the
main
altar
and
the
north
wall
of
the
transept
this
allows
for
observation
for
around
35
days
either
side
of
the
summer
solstice
due
to
settlement
in
the
building
and
also
movements
due
to
the
outside
temperature
changes
the
meridian
line
had
limited
astronomical
value
and
fell
into
disuse
until
it
was
restored
in
1755
by
leonardo
ximenes
40
the
meridian
line
was
covered

cracking
of
the
dome
edit
the
unreinforced
masonry
that
brunelleschi
used
to
construct
the
dome
is
weak
in
tension
which
leads
to
cracking
when
tensile
stresses
exceed
the
limited
masonry
tensile
strength
the
material
is
especially
susceptible
to
damage
from
seismic
loading
due
to
its
heterogeneity
and
many
surfaces
between
different
materials
stones
to
mortar
connection
41
cracking
of
the
dome
was
observed
even
before
its
construction
was
completed
it
is
possible
that
the
first
cracks
were
caused
by
a
strong
earthquake
in
1453
42
the
first
written
evidence
about
the
presence
of
cracks
appears
in
a
report
by
gherardo
silvani
report
dated
18
september
1639
which
refers
to
peli
hairs
42
in
1694
gianbattista
nelli
and
vincenzo
viviani
surveyed
the
cracks
with
nelli
recording
that
there
were
two
major
cracks
with
a
maximum
width
of
29
mm
1
1
in
42
they
believed
that
the
cracks
were
caused
by
the
weight
of
the
dome
and
the
resulting
horizontal
thrusts
on
the
pillars
a
commission
headed
by
vincenzo
viviani
carried
out
investigations
in
1695
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
cracking
was
due
to
the
dead
weight
of
the
buildings
it
was
proposed
that
the
dome
be
strengthened
by
installing
four
large
iron
belts
three
on
the
outside
of
the
dome
between
the
bulging
area
of
the
dome
and
the
circular
windows
while
the
fourth
would
be
installed
internally
in
the
second
walkway
between
the
two
shells
43
this
was
similar
to
what
had
been
done
on
the
dome
of
st
peter
s
in
rome
after
a
long
debate
a
decision
was
made
to
leave
the
dome
as
it
was
44
the
first
most
complete
survey
of
the
cracks
was
published
in
1757
by
the
jesuit
leonardo
ximenes
1716
1786
in
his
document
he
described
13
different
crack
typologies
42
45
in
1934
pier
luigi
nervi
who
was
head
of
a
special
commission
established
by
the
opera
del
duomo
to
study
the
cracking
observed
that
the
cracks
opened
and
closed
with
the
seasons
in
the
winter
the
dome
s
stone
and
bricks
would
contract
causing
the
cracks
to
widen
while
over
the
summer
the
materials
would
expand
and
the
cracks
would
close
up
while
modern
buildings
by
design
incorporate
expansion
joints
the
cathedral
s
dome
does
not
include
any
and
so
subsequently
developed
its
own
expansion
joints
in
the
form
of
these
cracks
which
allowed
the
structure
to
breathe
to
date
they
have
not
caused
any
catastrophic
damage
to
the
dome
46
in
1955
the
opera
del
duomo
installed
22
mechanical
deformometers
which
were
read
four
times
a
year
to
record
the
variations
in
the
width
of
the
major
cracks
in
the
inner
dome
at
the
same
time
the
dome
s
internal
and
external
temperatures
were
also
recorded
this
remained
in
service
until
2009
47
in
1975
a
commission
was
appointed
by
the
italian
government
to
safeguard
the
dome
44
in
1978
a
government
culture
agency
decided
to
restore
the
frescoes

left
forty
eight
600
mm

in
holes
in

base
of
the
dome
46
they
are
open
on
the
inside
and
covered
by
the
outer
skin
of
the
dome
it
has
long
been
assumed
that
the
holes
simply
served
as
mounts
for
the
scaffold
used
when
frescoes
were
painted
on
the
inside
of
the
dome
while
the
holes
had
been
able
to
support
the
scaffolding
used
for
the
creation
of
the
frescos
on
the
interior
of
the
dome
they
were
not
strong
enough
for
the
network
of
modern
metal
scaffolding
necessary
to
provide
access
for
the
restoration
work
undertaken
on
the
frescos
between
1979
and
1995
to
strengthen
the
scaffolding
the
private
company
contracted
to
build
scaffolding
for
the
work
was
allowed
in
1982
to
fill
the
holes
with
concrete
so
that
steel
beams
could
be
anchored
in
them
44
36
in
1985
local
architect
lando
bartoli
noticed
that
additional
cracks
were
forming
around
the
sealed
holes
it
was
theorized
at
the
time
that
in
summer
the
four
major
masses
separated
by
the
a
cracks
expanded
into
the
fissures
but
now
at
the
base
of
the
dome
the
masses
come
up
against
the
unyielding
concrete
that
now
fills
the
48
holes
acts
as
a
fulcrum
which
causes
the
energy
that
was
once
dissipated
with
the
closing
of
the
fissures
and
into
the
holes
to
be
transferred
into
the
upper
areas
of
the
dome
46

however
analysis
by
andrea
chiarugi
michele
fanelli
and
giuseppetti
published
in
1983
found
that
the
principal
source
of
the
cracks
was
a
dead
weight
effect
due
to
the
geometry
of
the
dome
its
weight
estimated
to
be
25
000
tons
36
and
the
insufficient
resistance
of
the
ring
beam
while
thermal
variations
has
caused
fatigue
loading
and
thus
expanding
of
the
structure
48
41
this
is
a
well
known
collapse
mechanism
typical
of
domed
structures
a
lowering
of
the
top
of
the
structure
under
its
own
weight
with
significant
horizontal
thrusts
on
the
bearing
elements
47
in
1985
a
commission
established
by
the
italian
ministry
of
cultural
and
monumental
heritage
accepted
this
theory
43

the
debate
about
the
filling
of
the
scaffolding
holes
was
finally
settled
in
1987
when
it
was
demonstrated
that
closing
the
48
holes
had
had
no
impact
on
the
expansion
and
contraction
of
the
dome
36
a
survey
completed
in
1984
counted
a
total
of
493
cracks
of
various
sizes
sorted
into
categories
identified
by
the
letters
a
through
d
46
these
are
as
follows
all
have
formed
in
a
symmetrical
pattern
the
development
of
the
type
a
cracks
means
that
the
dome
now
permanently
behaves
as
four
drifting
half
arches
linked
below
the
upper
oculus
45
the
abutments
of
these
half
arches
are
constituted
by
the
pillars
the
chapels
and
the
nave
of
the
church
the
differences
in
the
cracking
patterns
between
even
and
odd
webs
is
believed
to
be
due
to
variations
in
the
stiffness
of
the
supporting
ring
beam
structure
under
the
dome
as
it
is
supported
by
four
heavy
pillars
which
line
up
with
the
even
webs
while
the
odd
webs
are
located
over
four
arches
which
connect
the
pillars

in
1987
a

more
comprehensive
digital

is
responsible
for
the

47
a
linear
regression
analysis
of
the

data
has
shown
that
the

using
software
that
had
been
used
to
model
the
structures
of
large
dams
a
computer
model
of
the
dome
was
developed
in
1980
in
a
collaboration
between
italian
national
agency
for
electric
power
and
structural
and
hydraulic
research
centre
cris
by
a
group
of
researchers
led
by
michele
fanelli
and
gabriella
giuseppetti
in
cooperation
with
the
department
of
civil
engineering
of
the
university
of
florence
under
the
supervision
of
andrea
chiarugi
because
of
limited
computational
resources
and
for
reasons
of
symmetry
only
a
quarter
of
the
dome
was
modelled
the
resulting
finite
elements
analysis
confirmed
that
the
main
cracks
were
essentially
being
created
by
self
weight
of
the
dome
since
then
series
of
numerical
models
of
increasing
complexity
have
been
developed
to
assist
in
monitoring
of
the
dome
an
extensive
photogrammetric
and
topographical
survey
of
the
entire
dome
was
commissioned
in
1992
by
the
soprintendenza
the
results
of
this
survey
were
then
used
to
further
develop
the
finite
elements
model
of
the
dome
