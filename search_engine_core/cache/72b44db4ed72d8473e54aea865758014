southall

as
a
result
of
the
population
transfers
after
the

partition
of
india
over
ten
million
people
were
impoverished
from

a
significant
number
of
them
relocated
many
sikhs
and
hindus
left
the
subcontinent
to
settle
in
greater
london
particularly
southall
where
shortages
of
workers
at
factories
and
the
employment
prospects
at
nearby
heathrow
airport
meant
jobs
were
easily
obtainable

kennetta
hammond
perry
in
her
history
of

immigration
identifies
the
reasons
as
being
in
part
because
of
perceptions
about
their
level
of
competence
and
stereotypes
about
their
ability
to
speak
english
15
indian
workers
also
faced
discrimination
from
the
white
dominated
trade
unions
and
so
formed
their
own
organisation

indian
workers
association

special
patrol
group
edit
the
special
patrol
group
spg
was
formed
in
1961
as
a
specialist
squad
within
the
metropolitan
police
c
it
provided
a
mobile
centrally
controlled
reserve
of
uniformed
officers
which
supported
local
areas
particularly
when
policing
serious
crime
and
civil
disturbances
28
the
spg
comprised
police
officers
capable
of
working
as
disciplined
teams
preventing
public
disorder
targeting
areas
of
serious
crime
carrying
out
stop
and
searches
or
providing
a
response
to
terrorist
threats
29
30
in
1978
there
were
1
347
spg
members
in
forces
across
the
uk
204
of
them
in
the
metropolitan
police
service
they
were
divided
into
six
units
each
of
which
contained
three
sergeants
and
30
constables
each
unit
was
commanded
by
an
inspector
31
the
use
of
the
spg
proved
controversial
to
some
it
was
involved
in
the
red
lion
square
disorders
when
kevin
gately
a
student
demonstrating
against
a
national
front
march
was
killed
from
a
blow
to
the
head
from
a
blunt
instrument
the
perpetrator
was
never
identified
accusations
were
made
that
the
police
were
inappropriately
violent
towards
those
demonstrating
27
32
the
former
chief
constable
tim
brain
writes
their
critics
viewed
them
with
suspicion
as
a
force
within
a
force
the
metropolitan
police
history
observes
that
their
presence
sometimes
came
to
assume
unwanted
symbolic
significance
28
the
former
chief
constable
geoffrey
dear
states
that
the
spg
might
apparently
solve
one
problem
but
in
its
wake
create
another
of
aggravated
relationships
between
minority
groups
and
the
police
in

33
the
spg
was
disbanded
in
1986

with
a
policeman
standing
next
to
him
drove
the
coach
through
the
crowd
no
one
was
injured
but
eyewitnesses
said
that
the
mood
of
the
crowd
changed
at
that
point
two
spg
vans
drove
westwards
along
the
broadway
and
collected
two
crates
of
bricks
and
bottles
that
the

left
behind

turned
off

there

radioed
immediate
assistance
required
58
59
the
official
investigation
into
peach
s
death
states
that
the
events
leading
up
to
this
point
while
difficult
were
relatively
straightforward
but
that
further
description
of
what
happened
is
hampered
by
conflicting
accounts
that
have
been
given
by
private
persons
and
also
by

the

it

that
one

present
at

shaved
off
the

up

he
stated
the

untruthfulness

a
contributory
factor
88
he
continued
the
action

clearly
obstructed
the

carrying
out
their
duty
of
investigating

serious

89
cass
decided
that
he
had
identified
the
individual
whom
he
considered
most
likely
to
have
hit
peach

that
there
was
no
evidence

as

accurate
and
in
his
1983

mcnee
wrote
when
all
the
evidence
was
assembled
it
showed
that
blair
peach
had
died
from

blow

was
sent
to
the

who
while
praising

stated

reopened

both
burton

michael
dummett
wykeham
professor

observes
that
as
only
the
coroner

police
lawyers
had
copies
of
the
report
it
was
impossible
for
anyone
else
to
obtain
a
complete
picture
of
the
evidence
95
the
question
of
whether
the
family
were
allowed
to
view
the
reports
was
taken
to
a
divisional
court
who
ruled
that
as
the
report
was
the
property
of
the
police
they
had
the
right
to
withhold
it
95
legal
counsel
for
the
peach

rejected

was
again
adjourned
96
the
high

rejected
a
challenge
to
overturn
burton
s
decision
97
which
then
went
to
the
court

stated
that

included
in
both
publications
were
the
names
of
murray
white
freestone
richardson
and
scottow
100
the
latter
publication
indicated
that
the
decision
by
the
dpp
not
to
prosecute
the
policemen
left
the
investigating
officers
in
the
invidious
position
of
appearing
party
to
a
cover
up
should
their
report
ever
become
public
101

weeks
103
both
pathologists
david
bowen
for
the
coroner
and
keith
mant
acting
for
the
family
came
to
the
same
conclusions
that
death
was
from
a
single
blow
not
a
police
truncheon
but
a
rubber
cosh
or
hosepipe
filled
with
lead
shot
or
some
like
weapon
95
both
stated
that
peach
had
a
thin
skull
but
not
as
mant
observed
pathologically
thin
95
he
described
the
action
that
caused
the
injury
as
a
very
severe
single
blow
95
the
inquest
closed
on
27
may
1980
during
which
time
83
witnesses
were
called
104
a
verdict
of
death
by
misadventure
was
given
105
the
criminologists
phil
scraton
and
paul
gordon
consider
that
given
the
conclusions
of
the
cass
report
unlawful
killing
would
have
been
a
more
appropriate
verdict
106
in
its
leader
the
following
day
the
times
said
that
the
peach
inquest
failed
to
provide
a
clear
and
believable
explanation
of
the
events
in
question
it
also
stated
that
peach
s
death
should
continue
to
be
investigated
107
the
national
council
for
civil
liberties
expressed
concern
at
the
way
burton
conducted
the
inquest
the
organisation
felt
uneasy
with
a
theory
that
he
put
to
the
jury
that
peach
was
killed
by
some
political
fanatic
in
order
to
make
him
a
martyr
against
the
police
108
109
during
the
course
of
the
inquest
burton
wrote
to
ministers
to
say
that
the
question
of
whether
peach
was
killed
by
a
police
officer
was
a
political
fabrication
110
he
also
wrote
to
the
home
secretary
lord
chancellor
and
attorney
general
claiming
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
spread
false
information
about
peach
s
death
he
accused
several
media
outlets
including
the
bbc
of
producing
what
he
described
as
biased
propaganda
110
in
2010
the
daily
telegraph
considered
that
burton
had
shown
a
lack
of
sympathy
towards
mr
peach
s
death
111
after
the
inquest
burton
wrote
a
seven
page
article
entitled
the
blair
peach
inquest
the
unpublished
story
which
he
wanted
to
publish
in
the
coroners
society
annual
report
in
the
article
he
said
that
some
civilian
witnesses
lied
and
were
totally
politically
committed
to
the
socialist
workers
party
110
and
he
thought
that
some
of
the
sikh
witnesses
did
not
have
experience
of
the
english
system
to
give
reliable
evidence
55
he
was
persuaded
not
to
publish
the
account
by
civil
servants
who
considered
that
the
report
would
discredit
the
impartiality
of
coroners
in
general
and
dr
burton
in
particular
110
subsequent
events
edit
there
were
several
calls
for
a
public
inquiry
to
examine
the
circumstances
surrounding
peach
s
death
and
the
role
of
the
police
79
mps
supported
such
a
hearing
but
the
government
refused
to
hold
such
a
review
112
113
the
peach
family
also
challenged
the
metropolitan
police
in
court
for
the
cass
report
and
supporting
papers
to
be
released
in
february
1986
the
court
of
appeal
ruled
that
the
police
should
release
the
statements
and
supporting
papers
but
not
the
report
itself
114
the
family
also
sought
to
claim
damages
from
the
metropolitan
police
and
in
june
1988
after
eight
years
of
trying
they
were
awarded
75

115
k
the
political
historian
mick
ryan
observes
that
the
peach
case
is
an
example
where
compensation
is
paid
in
tacit
admission
that
a
wrong
had
been
committed
116
in
april
1999
paul
boateng
the
minister
of
state
for
home
affairs
was
the
final
minister

turned
down

request
for

inquiry
saying
the

had
happened
too
long
ago
to
be
beneficial
