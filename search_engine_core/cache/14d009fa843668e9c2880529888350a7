one
of
the
ancient
germanic
peoples
that
migrated
to
the
island
of
great
britain
english
is
the
most
spoken
language
in
the
world
primarily
due
to
the
global
influences
of
the
former
british
empire
succeeded
by
the
commonwealth

and
from

provides
about

now
comes

old

originated
from

tribal
and
linguistic
continuum
along
the
frisian
north
sea

whose

like

the
development
of
english
in
the
british
isles
isolated
it
from
the
continental
germanic
languages
and
influences
and
it
has
since
diverged
considerably
english
is
not
mutually
intelligible
with
any
continental
germanic
language
differing
in
vocabulary
syntax
and
phonology
although
some
of
these
such
as
dutch
or
frisian
do
show
strong
affinities
with
english
especially
with
its
earlier
stages
20
unlike
icelandic
and
faroese
which
were
isolated
the
development
of
english
was
influenced
by
a
long
series
of
invasions
of
the
british
isles
by
other
peoples
and
languages
particularly
old
norse
and
french
dialects
these
left
a
profound
mark
of
their
own
on
the
language
so
that
english
shows
some
similarities
in
vocabulary
and
grammar
with
many
languages
outside
its
linguistic
clades
but
it
is
not
mutually
intelligible
with
any
of
those
languages
either
some
scholars
have
argued
that
english
can
be
considered
a
mixed
language
or
a
creole
a
theory
called
the
middle
english
creole
hypothesis
although
the
great
influence
of
these
languages
on
the
vocabulary
and
grammar
of
modern
english
is
widely
acknowledged
most
specialists
in
language
contact
do
not
consider
english
to
be
a
true
mixed
language
21
22
english
is
classified
as
a
germanic
language
because
it
shares
innovations
with
other
germanic
languages
such
as
dutch
german
and
swedish
23
these
shared
innovations
show
that
the
languages
have
descended
from
a
single
common
ancestor
called
proto
germanic
some
shared
features
of
germanic
languages
include
the
division
of
verbs
into
strong
and
weak
classes
the
use
of
modal
verbs
and
the
sound
changes
affecting
proto
indo
european
consonants
known
as
grimm
s
and
verner
s
laws
english
is
classified
as
an
anglo
frisian
language
because
frisian
and
english
share
other
features
such
as
the
palatalisation
of
consonants

is
often
arbitrarily
defined
as
beginning
with
the
conquest
of

by
william
the
conqueror
in

it

the

french
spoken

norman
was
spoken
primarily
by
the
elites
and
nobles
while
the
lower
classes
continued
speaking
english
the
main
influence
of
norman
was
the
introduction
of
a
wide
range
of
loanwords
related
to
politics
legislation
and
prestigious
social
domains
14
middle
english
also
greatly
simplified
the
inflectional
system
probably
in
order
to
reconcile
old
norse
and
old
english
which
were
inflectionally
different
but
morphologically
similar
the
distinction
between
nominative
and
accusative
cases
was
lost
except
in
personal
pronouns
the
instrumental
case
was
dropped
and
the
use
of
the
genitive
case
was
limited
to
indicating
possession
the
inflectional
system
regularised
many
irregular
inflectional
forms

inflectional
simplification
and
linguistic
standardisation
the
great
vowel
shift
affected
the
stressed
long
vowels
of
middle
english
it
was
a
chain
shift
meaning
that
each
shift
triggered
a
subsequent
shift
in
the
vowel
system
mid
and
open
vowels
were
raised
and
close
vowels
were
broken
into
diphthongs
for
example
the
word
bite
was
originally
pronounced
as
the
word
beet
is
today
and
the
second
vowel
in
the
word
about
was
pronounced
as
the
word
boot
is
today
the
great
vowel
shift
explains
many
irregularities
in
spelling
since
english
retains
many
spellings
from
middle

and
it
also
explains
why

globally
has
had
an
effect
on
other
languages
leading
to
some
english
words
being
assimilated
into
the
vocabularies
of
other
languages
this
influence
of
english
has
led
to
concerns
about
language
death
134
and
to
claims
of
linguistic
imperialism
135
and
has
provoked
resistance
to
the
spread
of
english
however
the
number
of
speakers
continues
to
increase
because
many
people
around
the
world
think
that
english
provides
them
with
opportunities
for
better
employment
and
improved
lives
136
though
some
mention
a
possibility
of
divergence
of
english
dialects
into
mutually
unintelligible
languages
most
think
a
more
likely
outcome
is
that
english
will
continue
to
function
as
a
koineised
language
in
which
the
standard
form
unifies
speakers
from
around
the
world
137
english
is
used
as
the
language
for
wider
communication
in
countries
around
the
world
138
thus
english
has
grown
in
worldwide
use
much
more
than
any
constructed
language
proposed
as
an
international
auxiliary

stress
rhythm
and
intonationstress
plays
an
important
role
in
english
certain
syllables
are
stressed
while
others
are
unstressed
stress
is
a
combination
of
duration
intensity
vowel
quality
and
sometimes
changes
in
pitch
stressed
syllables
are
pronounced
longer
and
louder
than
unstressed
syllables
and
vowels
in
unstressed
syllables
are
frequently
reduced
while
vowels
in
stressed
syllables
are
not
159
some
words
primarily
short
function
words
but
also
some
modal
verbs
such
as
can
have
weak
and
strong
forms
depending
on
whether
they
occur
in
stressed
or
non
stressed
position
within
a
sentence
stress
in
english
is
phonemic
and
some
pairs
of
words
are
distinguished
by
stress
for
instance
the
word
contract
is
stressed
on
the
first
syllable
ˈkɒntrækt
kon
trakt
when
used
as
a
noun
but
on
the
last
syllable
kənˈtrækt
kən
trakt
for
most
meanings
for
example
reduce
in
size
when
used
as
a
verb
160
161
162
here
stress
is
connected
to
vowel
reduction
in
the
noun
contract
the
first
syllable
is
stressed
and
has
the
unreduced
vowel
ɒ
but
in
the
verb
contract
the
first
syllable
is
unstressed
and
its
vowel
is
reduced
to
ə
stress
is
also
used
to
distinguish
between
words
and
phrases
so
that
a
compound
word
receives
a
single
stress
unit
but
the
corresponding
phrase
has
two
e
g
a
burnout
ˈbɜːrnaʊt
versus
to
burn
out
ˈbɜːrn
ˈaʊt
and
a
hotdog
ˈhɒtdɒɡ
versus
a
hot
dog
ˈhɒt
ˈdɒɡ
163
in
terms
of
rhythm
english
is
generally
described
as
a
stress
timed
language
meaning
that
the
amount
of
time
between
stressed
syllables
tends
to
be
equal
164
stressed
syllables
are
pronounced
longer
but
unstressed
syllables
syllables
between
stresses
are
shortened
vowels
in
unstressed
syllables
are
shortened
as
well
and
vowel
shortening
causes
changes
in
vowel
quality
vowel
reduction

the

is
used
in
the
sense
both
of
the

the
dependent

functions
as
a
determiner
specifying

an

finite
verbal
clauses
are
those
that
are
formed
around

in
the
present
or
preterite
form
in
clauses
with
auxiliary
verbs
they
are
the
finite

and
the
main
verb
is
treated
as
a
subordinate
clause
205
for
example
he
has
to
go
where
only
the
auxiliary
verb
have
is
inflected
for
time
and
the
main
verb
to
go
is
in
the
infinitive
or
in
a
complement
clause
such
as
i

where
the
main
verb
is

is
in

phrasal
verbsenglish
also
makes
frequent
use
of
constructions
traditionally
called
phrasal
verbs
verb
phrases
that
are
made
up
of
a
verb
root
and
a
preposition
or
particle
that
follows
the
verb
the
phrase
then
functions
as
a
single
predicate
in
terms
of
intonation
the
preposition
is
fused
to
the
verb
but
in
writing
it
is
written
as
a
separate
word
examples
of
phrasal
verbs
are
to
get
up
to
ask
out
to
back
up
to
give
up
to
get
together
to
hang
out
to
put
up
with
etc
the
phrasal
verb
frequently
has
a
highly
idiomatic
meaning
that
is
more
specialised
and
restricted
than
what
can
be
simply
extrapolated
from
the
combination
of
verb
and
preposition
complement
e
g
lay
off
meaning
terminate
someone
s
employment
206
in
spite
of
the
idiomatic
meaning
some
grammarians
including
huddleston
pullum
2002
274
do
not
consider
this
type
of
construction
to
form
a
syntactic
constituent
and
hence
refrain
from
using
the
term
phrasal
verb
instead
they
consider
the
construction
simply
to
be
a
verb
with
a
prepositional
phrase
as
its
syntactic
complement
i

the
example
below
demonstrates
how
the
grammatical
roles
of
each

are
marked
only
by

an
exception

in
sentences

it

both
by

auxiliary
verb
constructionsenglish
syntax
relies
on
auxiliary
verbs
for
many
functions
including
the
expression
of
tense
aspect
and
mood
auxiliary
verbs
form
main
clauses
and
the
main
verbs
function
as
heads
of
a
subordinate
clause
of
the
auxiliary
verb
for
example
in
the
sentence
the
dog
did
not
find
its
bone
the
clause
find
its
bone
is
the
complement
of
the
negated
verb
did
not
subject
auxiliary
inversion
is
used
in
many
constructions
including
focus
negation
and
interrogative
constructions
the
verb
do
can
be
used
as
an
auxiliary
even
in
simple
declarative
sentences
where
it
usually
serves
to
add
emphasis
as
in
i
did
shut
the
fridge
however
in
the
negated
and
inverted
clauses
referred
to
above
it
is
used
because
the
rules
of
english
syntax
permit
these
constructions
only
when
an
auxiliary
is
present
modern
english
does
not
allow
the
addition
of
the
negating
adverb
not
to
an
ordinary
finite
lexical
verb
as
in
i
know
not
it
can
only
be
added
to
an
auxiliary
or
copular
verb
hence
if
there
is
no
other
auxiliary
present
when
negation
is
required
the
auxiliary
do
is
used
to
produce
a
form
like
i
do
not
don
t
know
the
same
applies
in
clauses
requiring
inversion
including
most
questions
inversion
must
involve
the
subject
and
an
auxiliary
verb
so
it
is
not
possible
to
say
know
you
him
grammatical
rules
require
do
you
know
him
215
negation
is
done
with
the
adverb
not
which
precedes
the
main
verb
and
follows
an
auxiliary
verb
a
contracted
form
of
not
n
t
can
be
used
as
an
enclitic
attaching
to
auxiliary
verbs
and
to
the
copula
verb
to
be
just
as
with
questions
many
negative
constructions
require
the
negation
to
occur
with
do
support
thus
in
modern
english
i
don
t
know
him
is
the
correct
answer
to
the
question
do
you
know
him
but
not
i
know
him
not
although
this
construction
may
be
found
in
older
english
216
passive
constructions
also
use
auxiliary
verbs
a
passive
construction
rephrases
an
active
construction
in
such
a
way
that
the
object
of
the
active
phrase
becomes
the
subject
of
the
passive
phrase
and
the
subject
of
the
active
phrase
is
either
omitted
or
demoted
to
a
role
as
an
oblique
argument
introduced
in
a
prepositional
phrase
they
are
formed
by
using
the
past
participle
either
with
the
auxiliary
verb
to
be
or
to
get
although
not
all
varieties
of
english
allow
the
use
of
passives
with
get

example
putting
the

discourse
level
syntaxwhile
english
is
a
subject
prominent
language
at
the
discourse
level
it
tends
to
use
a
topic
comment
structure
where
the
known
information
topic
precedes
the
new
information
comment
because
of
the
strict
svo
syntax
the
topic
of
a
sentence
generally
has
to
be
the
grammatical
subject
of
the
sentence
in
cases
where
the
topic
is
not
the
grammatical
subject
of
the
sentence
it
is
often
promoted
to
subject
position
through
syntactic
means
one
way
of
doing
this
is
through
a
passive
construction
the
girl
was
stung
by
the
bee
another
way
is
through
a
cleft
sentence
where
the
main
clause
is
demoted
to
be
a
complement
clause
of
a
copula
sentence
with
a
dummy
subject
such
as
it
or
there
e
g
it
was
the
girl
that
the
bee
stung
there
was
a
girl
who
was
stung
by
a
bee
219
dummy
subjects
are
also
used
in
constructions
where
there
is
no
grammatical
subject
such
as
with
impersonal
verbs
e
g
it
is
raining
or
in
existential
clauses
there
are
many
cars
on
the
street
through
the
use
of
these
complex
sentence
constructions
with
informationally
vacuous
subjects
english
is
able
to
maintain
both
a
topic
comment
sentence
structure
and
a
svo
syntax
focus
constructions
emphasise
a
particular
piece
of
new
or
salient
information
within
a
sentence
generally
through
allocating
the
main
sentence
level
stress
on
the
focal
constituent
for
example
the
girl
was
stung
by
a
bee
emphasising
it
was
a
bee
and
not
for
example
a
wasp
that
stung
her
or
the
girl
was
stung
by
a
bee
contrasting
with
another
possibility
for
example
that
it
was
the
boy
220
topic
and
focus
can
also
be
established
through
syntactic
dislocation
either
preposing
or
postposing
the
item
to
be
focused
on
relative
to
the
main
clause
for
example
that
girl
over
there
she
was
stung
by
a
bee
emphasises
the
girl
by
preposition
but
a
similar
effect
could
be
achieved
by
postposition
she
was
stung
by
a
bee
that
girl
over
there
where
reference
to
the
girl
is
established
as
an
afterthought
221
cohesion
between
sentences
is
achieved
through
the
use
of
deictic
pronouns
as
anaphora
e
g
that
is
exactly
what
i
mean
where
that
refers
to
some
fact
known
to
both
interlocutors
or
then
used
to
locate
the
time
of
a
narrated
event
relative
to
the
time
of
a
previously
narrated
event
222
discourse
markers
such
as
oh
so
or
well
also
signal
the
progression
of
ideas
between
sentences
and
help
to
create
cohesion
discourse
markers
are
often
the
first
constituents
in
sentences
discourse
markers
are
also
used
for
stance
taking
in
which
speakers
position
themselves
in
a
specific
attitude
towards
what
is
being
said
for
example
no
way
is
that
true
the
idiomatic
marker
no
way
expressing
disbelief
or
boy
i
m
hungry
the
marker
boy
expressing
emphasis
while
discourse
markers
are
particularly
characteristic
of
informal
and
spoken
registers
of
english
they
are
also
used
in
written
and
formal
registers
223
vocabularyit
is
generally
stated
that
english
has
around
170
000
words
or
220
000
if
obsolete
words
are
counted
this
estimate
is
based
on
the
last
full
edition
of
the
oxford
english
dictionary
from
1989
224
over
half
of
these
words
are
nouns
a
quarter
adjectives
and
a
seventh
verbs
there
is
one
count
that
puts
the
english
vocabulary
at
about
1
million
words
but
that
count
presumably
includes
words
such
as
latin

botanical
terms
prefixed
and
suffixed

jargon
foreign
words
of
extremely
limited

225
due
to
its
status
as
an
international
language
english
adopts
foreign
words
quickly
and
borrows
vocabulary

many
other
sources
early
studies
of
english
vocabulary
by
lexicographers
the
scholars

forms
new
words
from
existing
words
or
roots
in
its
vocabulary
through
a
variety
of
processes
one
of
the
most
productive
processes
in
english
is
conversion
228
using
a
word
with
a
different
grammatical
role
for
example
using
a
noun
as
a
verb
or
a
verb
as
a
noun
another
productive
word
formation
process
is
nominal
compounding
225
227
producing
compound
words
such
as
babysitter
or
ice
cream
or
homesick
228
a
process
more
common
in
old
english
than
in
modern
english
but
still
productive
in
modern
english
is
the
use
of
derivational
suffixes
hood
ness
ing
ility
to
derive
new
words
from
existing
words
especially
those
of
germanic
origin
or
stems
especially
for
words
of
latin
or
greek
origin
formation
of
new
words
called
neologisms
based
on
greek
and
or
latin
roots
for
example
television
or
optometry
is
a
highly
productive
process
in
english
and
in
most
modern
european
languages
so
much
so
that
it
is
often
difficult
to
determine
in
which
language
a
neologism
originated
for
this
reason

another
active

in

english
besides
forming
new
words
from
existing
words
and
their
roots
also
borrows
words
from
other
languages
this
borrowing
is
commonplace
in
many
world
languages
but
english
has
been
especially
open
to
borrowing
of
foreign
words
throughout
the
last
1
000
years
231
nevertheless
most
of
the
core
vocabulary
and
the
most
common
words
in
english
are
still
west
germanic
232
233
the
english
words
first
learned
by
children
as
they
learn
to
speak
are
mainly
germanic
words
from
old
english
225
it
is
not
possible
to
speak
or
write
english
without
germanic
words
but
it
is
possible
to
write
or
speak
many
sentences
in
english
without
foreign
loanwords
234
but
one
of
the
consequences
of
long
language
contact
between
french
and
english
in
all
stages
of
their
development
is
that
the
vocabulary
of
english
has
a
very
high
percentage
of
latinate
words
derived
from
french
especially
and
also
from
other
romance
languages
and
latin
french
words
from
various
periods
of
the
development
of
french
now
make
up
one
third
of
the
vocabulary
of
english
235
linguist
anthony
lacoudre
estimated
that
over
40
000
english
words
are
of
french
origin
and
may
be
understood
without
orthographical
change
by
french
speakers
236
words
of
old
norse
origin
have
entered
the
english
language
primarily
from
the
contact
between
old
norse
and
old
english
during
colonisation
of
eastern
and
northern
england
many
of
these
words
are
part
of
english
core
vocabulary
such
as
egg
and
knife
237
english
has
also
borrowed
many
words
directly
from
latin
the
ancestor
of
the
romance
languages
during
all
stages
of
its
development
227
225
many
of
these
words
had
earlier
been
borrowed
into
latin
from
greek
latin
or
greek
are
still
highly
productive
sources
of
stems
used
to
form
vocabulary
of
subjects
learned
in
higher
education
such
as
the
sciences

and

238
english
continues
to
gain
new
loanwords
and
calques
loan
translations
from
languages
all
over
the
world
and
words
from
languages
other
than
the
ancestral
anglo
saxon
language
make
up
about
60
of
the
vocabulary
of
english
239
english
has
formal
and
informal
speech
registers
informal
registers
including
child
directed
speech
tend
to
be
made
up
predominantly
of
words
of
anglo
saxon
origin
while
the
percentage
of
vocabulary
that
is
of
latinate

has
had
a
strong
influence
on

235
242
the
influence
of
english
comes
from
such
factors
as
opinion
leaders
in
other
countries
knowing
the
english
language
the
role
of
english
as
a
world
lingua
franca
and
the
large
number
of
books
and
films
that
are
translated
from
english
into
other
languages
243
that
pervasive
use
of
english
leads
to
a
conclusion
in
many
places
that
english
is
an
especially
suitable
language
for
expressing
new
ideas
or
describing
new
technologies
among
varieties
of
english
it
is
especially
american
english
that
influences
other
languages
244
some
languages
such
as
chinese
write
words
borrowed
from
english
mostly
as
calques
while
others
such
as
japanese
readily
take
in
english
loanwords
written
in

are
an
especially
fruitful
source

the

246
further

which
the

has
not

51
compared
to

for
which
official

english
has
spelling
that
is
a
less
consistent
indicator
of
pronunciation
and
standard
spellings
of
words
that
are
more
difficult
to
guess
from
knowing
how
a
word
is
pronounced
247
there
are
also
systematic
spelling
differences
between
british
and
american
english
these
situations
have
prompted
proposals
for
spelling
reform
in
english
248
although
letters
and
speech
sounds
do
not
have
a
one

spelling

take
into

phonetic

for

249
moreover
standard
english
spelling
shows
etymological
relationships
between
related
words
that
would
be
obscured
by
a
closer
correspondence
between
pronunciation
and
spelling
for
example
the
words

and

249
or
the
words
electricity

while
few
scholars
agree
with
chomsky
and
halle
1968
that
conventional
english
orthography
is
near
optimal
246
there
is
a
rationale
for
current
english
spelling
patterns
250
the
standard
orthography
of
english
is
the
most
widely
used
writing
system
in
the
world
251
standard
english
spelling
is
based
on
a
graphomorphemic
segmentation
of
words
into
written
clues
of
what
meaningful
units
make
up
each
word
252
readers
of
english
can
generally
rely
on
the
correspondence
between
spelling
and
pronunciation
to
be
fairly
regular
for
letters

digraphs
used
to

but
there
is
also
a

pronounced
s
and
a
soft

pronounced

the
differences
in
the
pronunciations
of
the
letters
c

are
often
signalled
by
the
following
letters
in
standard
english
spelling
digraphs
used
to
represent

and

sequences
include
ch

or
ð
ng
for

qu

words
the

generally
pronounced
as
z
in
word
initial
position
and
as
ks
otherwise
there
are
exceptions
to
these
generalisations
often
the
result
of
loanwords
being
spelled
according
to
the
spelling
patterns
of
their
languages
of
origin
249
or
residues
of
proposals
by
scholars
in
the
early
period
of
modern
english
to
follow
the
spelling
patterns
of
latin
for
english
words
of
germanic
origin
253
for
the
vowel
sounds
of
the
english
language
however
correspondences
between
spelling
and
pronunciation
are
more
irregular
there
are
many
more
vowel
phonemes
in
english
than
there
are
single
vowel
letters
a
e
i
o
u
w
y
as
a
result
some
long
vowels
are
often
indicated
by
combinations
of
letters
like
the
oa
in
boat
the
ow
in
how
and
the
ay
in
stay
or
the
historically
based
silent
e
as
in
note
and
cake
250
the
consequence
of
this
complex
orthographic
history
is
that
learning
to
read
and
write
can
be
challenging
in
english
it
can
take
longer
for
school
pupils
to
become
independently
fluent
readers
of
english
than
of
many
other
languages
including
italian
spanish
and
german
254
nonetheless
there
is
an
advantage
for
learners
of
english
reading
in
learning
the
specific
sound
symbol
regularities
that
occur
in
the
standard
english
spellings
of
commonly
used
words
249
such
instruction
greatly
reduces
the
risk
of

255
256

primary

more
aware
of
the
primacy
of
morpheme

in
english
may
help
learners
learn
more
efficiently
to
read
and
write
english
257
english
writing
also
includes
a
system
of
punctuation
marks
that
is
similar
to
those
used
in
most
alphabetic
languages
around
the
world
the
purpose
of
punctuation
is
to
mark
meaningful
grammatical
relationships
in
sentences
to
aid
readers
in
understanding
a
text
and
to
indicate
features
important
for
reading

dialects

identify
many
english
dialects
which
usually
refer
to
regional
varieties
that
differ
from
each
other
in
terms
of
patterns
of

the

there
is
also
considerable

along
lines
of

some
traits
though
exceedingly
common
are
nonetheless
considered
non

and
associated
with
lower

identities
an
example
of
this
is

was

particularly
cockney

in

can

south

english
also
known
as
west

english
midlands
english
and
northern
english
within
each
of
these
regions
several
local
dialects
exist
within
the
northern
region
there
is
a
division
between
the
yorkshire
dialects
the
geordie
dialect
spoken
around
newcastle
in
northumbria
and
the
lancashire
dialects
which
include
the
urban
subdialects
of
manchester

having
been
the
centre
of
danish
occupation
during

of

northern
english
dialects
particularly
the

retain
norse
features
not
found
in
other
english
varieties
265
since

15th
century
south

varieties
have
centred
on
london
which
has
been
the
centre
from
which
dialectal
innovations
have
spread
to
other
dialects
in
london
the
cockney
dialect
was
traditionally
used
by
the
lower
classes
and
it
was
long
a
socially
stigmatised
variety
the
spread
of
cockney
features
across
the
south
east
led
the
media
to
talk
of
estuary
english
as
a
new
dialect
but
the
notion
was
criticised
by
many
linguists
on
the
grounds
that
london
had
been
influencing
neighbouring
regions
throughout
history
266
267
