the
avengers
are
an
all
star
ensemble
cast
of
established
superhero
characters
from
the
marvel
comics
portfolio
diegetically
these
superheroes
usually
operate
independently
but
occasionally
assemble
as
a
team
to
tackle
especially
formidable
villains
this
in
contrast
to
certain
other
superhero
teams
such
as
the
x
men
whose
characters
were
created
specifically
to
be
part
of
their
team
with
the
team
being
central
to
their
identity
the
avengers
were
created
to
create
a
new
line
of
books
to
sell
and
to
cross
promote
marvel
comics
characters
an
iron
man
fan
might
buy
an
avengers
book
because
iron
man
appears
in
them
and
perhaps
in
turn
take
an
interest
in
thor
who
appears
in
the
same
book
as
iron
man
s
friend
and
comrade
2
the
cast
usually
features
a
few
highly
popular
characters
who
have
their
own
solo
books
such
as
iron
man
alongside
a
number
of
lesser
known
characters
who
benefit
from
exposure
such
as
quicksilver

have
appeared
in
a

gyrich
was
prejudiced
against
superhumans
and
acted
in
a
heavy
handed
obstructive
manner

insisted
that
the
avengers
follow
government
rules

else
lose
their
priority
status
with
the
government
among
gyrich
s
demands
was
that

that
the
falcon
an
african
american
be
admitted
to

last
act

resented

because
of
the
seven
member
limit
lost
his
membership
slot
to
the
falcon
81
the
falcon
in

was
unhappy
to

the
first
major
development
was
the
breakdown
of

with
his
frequent
changes
of

symptomatic
of

before

were
usually
isolated
productions
mostly
because

the

has
led
to
its
continued
growing
success

warner
