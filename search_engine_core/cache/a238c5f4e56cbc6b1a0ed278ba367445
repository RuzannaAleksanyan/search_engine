2
march
672
was
a
prominent
7th
century
anglo
saxon
catholic
monk
who
became
abbot
of
several
monasteries
bishop
of
the
northumbrians
and
subsequently
bishop
of
the
mercians
and
lindsey
people
he
was
later
canonised
as
a
saint
he
was
the
brother
of
cedd
also
a
saint
he
features
strongly
in
the
work
of
the
venerable
bede
and
is
credited
together
with
cedd
with
introducing
christianity
to
the
mercian
kingdom
sources
edit
most
of
what
is
known
of
chad
comes
from
the
writings
of
the
venerable
bede
1
bede
tells
us
that
he
obtained
his
information
about
chad
and
his
brother
cedd
from
the
monks
of
lastingham
2
where
both
were
abbots
bede
also
refers
to
information
he
received
from
trumbert
who
tutored
me
in
the
scriptures
and
who
had
been
educated
in
the
monastery
by
that
master
3
i
e
chad
in
other
words
bede
considered
himself
to
stand
in
the
spiritual
lineage
of
chad
and
had
gathered
information
from
at
least
one
who
knew
him
personally

chad
was
one
of
four
brothers
all
active
in
the
anglo

church

others
were

chad
seems
to
have
been
cedd
s
junior
arriving
on
the
political
scene
about
ten
years
after
cedd
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
chad
and
his
brothers
were
drawn
from
the
northumbrian
nobility
5
they
certainly
had
close
connections
throughout
the
northumbrian
ruling
class
however
the
name
chad
is
actually
of
british
celtic
rather
than
anglo
saxon
origin
6
it
is
an
element
found
in
the
personal
names
of
many
welsh
princes
and
nobles
of
the
period
and
signifies
battle
education
edit
the
only
major
fact
that
bede
gives
about
chad
s
early
life
is
that
he
was
a
student
of
aidan
at
the
celtic
monastery
at
lindisfarne
7
in
fact
bede
attributes
the
general
pattern
of
chad
s
ministry
to
the
example
of
aidan
and
his
own
brother
cedd
who
was
also
a
student
of
st
aidan
aidan
was
a
disciple
of
columba
and
was
invited
by
king
oswald
of
northumbria
to
come
from
iona
to
establish
a
monastery
aidan
arrived
in
northumbria
in
635
and
died
in
651
chad
must
have
studied
at
lindisfarne
some
time
between
these
years
travels
in
ireland
and
dating
of
chad
s
life
edit
a
number
of
ecclesiastical
settlements
were
established
in
7th
century
ireland
to
accommodate
european
monks
particularly
anglo
saxon
monks
around
668
bishop
colman
resigned
his
see
at
lindisfarne
and
returned
to
ireland
less
than
three
years
later
he
erected
an
abbey
in
county

exclusively
for
the
english
monks

chad
traveled
to
ireland
as
a
monk
3
before
he
was
ordained
a
priest
one
of
his
companions
was
egbert
of
ripon
egbert
was
of
the
anglian
nobility
probably
from
northumbria
bede
places
them
among
an
influx
of
english
scholars
who
arrived
in
ireland
while
finan
and
colmán
were
bishops
at
lindisfarne
this
suggests
that
they
left
for
ireland
some
time
after
aidan
s
death
in
651
they
went
to
rath
melsigi
an
anglo
saxon
monastery
in
county
carlow
for
further
study
in
the
controversy
over
the
keeping
of

roman
computation
in
664
the
twenty
five
year
old
egbert
barely
survived
a
plague
that
had
killed
all
his
other
companions
9
chad
had
by
then
already
left
ireland
to
help
his
brother
cedd
establish
the
monastery
of
laestingaeu
in
yorkshire
the
benedictine
rule
was
slowly
spreading
across
western
europe
chad
was
trained
in
an
entirely
distinct
monastic
tradition
that
tended
to
look
back
to
martin
of
tours
as
an
exemplar
10
the
irish
and
early
anglo
saxon
monasticism
experienced
by
chad
was
peripatetic
stressed
ascetic
practices
and
had
a
strong
focus
on
biblical
exegesis
which
generated
a
profound
eschatological
consciousness
egbert
recalled
later
that
he
and
chad
followed
the
monastic
life
together
very
strictly
in
prayers
and
continence
and
in
meditation
on
holy
scripture
some
of
the
scholars
quickly
settled
in
irish
monasteries
while
others
wandered
from
one
master
to
another
in
search
of
knowledge
bede
says
that
the
irish
monks
gladly
taught
them
and
fed
them
and
even
let
them
use
their
valuable
books
without
charge
since
books
were
all
produced
by
hand
with
painstaking
attention
to
detail
this
was
astonishingly
generous

the
coastal

cælin
was
chaplain
at
œthelwald

it
was
on

became
a
base
for
cedd
who
was
serving
as
a
missionary

essex
bede
says
that
cedd
fasted
strictly
in
order
to
cleanse
it
from
the
filth
of
wickedness

committed

on
the
thirtieth

remaining
ten
days

indicates

with
northumbria

ruling
dynasty
laestingaeu
was
clearly
conceived
as
a
base
for
the
family
and
destined
to
be
under
their
control
for
the
foreseeable
future
not
an
unusual
arrangement
in

abbot
of
lastingham
edit
chad
s
first
appearance
as
an
ecclesiastical
prelate
occurs
in
664
shortly
after
the
synod
of
whitby
when
many
church
leaders
had
been
wiped
out
by
the
plague
among
them
cedd
who
died
that
year
at
lastingham
on
the
death
of
his
elder
brother
chad
succeeded
to
the
position
of
abbot
4
bede
tells
us
of
a
man
called
owin
owen
who
appeared
at
the
door
of
lastingham
owin
was
a
household
official
of
æthelthryth
an
east
anglian
princess
who
had
come
to
marry
ecgfrith
oswiu
s
younger
son
he
decided
to
renounce
the
world
and
as
a
sign
of
this
appeared
at
lastingham
in
ragged
clothes
and
carrying
an
axe
he
had
come
primarily
to
work
manually
he
became
one
of
chad
s
closest
associates
chad
s
eschatological
consciousness
and
its
effect
on
others
is
brought
to
life
in
a
reminiscence
attributed
to
trumbert
3
who
was
one
of
his
students
at
lastingham
chad
used
to
break
off
reading
whenever
a
gale
sprang
up
and
call
on
god
to
have
pity
on
humanity
if
the
storm
intensified
he
would
shut
his
book
altogether
and
prostrate
himself
in
prayer
during
prolonged
storms
or
thunderstorms
he
would
go
into
the
church
itself
to
pray
and
sing
psalms
until
calm
returned
his
monks
obviously
regarded
this
as
an
extreme
reaction
even
to
english
weather
and
asked
him
to
explain
chad
explained
that
storms
are
sent
by
god
to
remind
humans
of
the
day
of
judgement
and
to
humble
their
pride
the
typically
celtic
christian
involvement
with
nature
was
not
like
the
modern
romantic
preoccupation
but
a
determination
to
read
in
it
the
mind
of
god
particularly
in
relation
to
the
last
things

rise
of
a
dynasty
edit
it
is
possible
that
he
had
only
recently
returned
from
ireland
when
prominence
was
thrust
upon
him
however
the
growing
importance
of
his
family
within
the
northumbrian
state
is
clear
from
bede
s
account
of
cedd
s
career
of
the
founding
of
their
monastery
at
lastingham
in
north
yorkshire
4
this
concentration
of
ecclesiastical
power
and
influence
within
the
network
of
a
noble
family
was
probably
common
in
anglo
saxon
england
an
obvious
parallel
would
be
the
children
of
king
merewalh
in
mercia
in
the
following
generation
cedd
probably
the
elder
brother
had
become
a
very
prominent
figure
in
the
church
while
chad
was
in
ireland
probably
as
a
newly
ordained
priest
he
was
sent
in
653
by
oswiu
on
a
difficult
mission
to
the
middle
angles
at
the
request
of
their
sub
king
peada
part
of
a
developing
pattern
of
northumbrian
intervention
in
mercian
affairs
after
perhaps
a
year
he
was
recalled
and
sent
on
a
similar
mission
to
the
east
saxons
being
ordained
bishop
shortly
afterwards
cedd
s
position
as
both
a
christian
missionary
and
a
royal
emissary
compelled
him
to
travel
often
between
essex
and
northumbria
bishop
of
the
northumbrians
edit
need
for
a
bishop
edit
bede
gives
great
prominence
to
the
synod
of
whitby
14
in
663
4
which
he
shows
resolving
the
main
issues
of
practice
in
the
northumbrian
church
in
favour
of
roman
practice
cedd
is
shown
acting
as
the
main
go
between
in
the
synod
because
of
his
facility
with
all
of
the
relevant
languages
cedd
was
not
the
only
prominent
churchman
to
die
of
plague
shortly
after
the
synod
this
was
one
of
several
outbreaks
of
the
plague
they
badly
hit
the
ranks
of
the
church
leadership
with
most
of
the
bishops
in
the
anglo
saxon
kingdoms
dead
including
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
bede
tells
us
that
colmán
the
bishop
of
the
northumbrians
at
the
time
of
the
synod
had
left
for
scotland
after
the
synod
went
against
him
he
was
succeeded
by
tuda
who
lived
only
a
short
time
after
his
accession
the
tortuous
process
of
replacing
him
is
covered
by
bede
7
briefly
but
in
some
respects
puzzlingly
mission
of
wilfrid
edit
the
first
choice
to
replace
tuda
was
wilfrid
a
particularly
zealous
partisan
of
the
roman
cause
because
of
the
plague
there
were
not
the
requisite
three
bishops
available
to
ordain
him
so
he
had
gone
to
the
frankish
kingdom
of
neustria
to
seek
ordination
this
was
on
the
initiative
of
alfrid
sub
king
of
deira
although
presumably
oswiu
knew
and
approved
this
action
at
the
time
bede
tells
us
that
alfrid
sought
a
bishop
for
himself
and
his
own
people
this
probably
means
the
people
of
deira
according
to
bede
tuda
had
been
succeeded
as
abbot
of
lindisfarne
by
eata
who
had
been
elevated
to
the
rank
of
bishop
wilfrid
met
with
his
own
teacher
and
patron
agilbert
a
spokesman
for
the
roman
side
at
whitby
who
had
been
made
bishop
of
paris
agilbert
set
in
motion
the
process
of
ordaining
wilfrid
canonically
summoning
several
bishops
to
compiègne
for
the
ceremony
bede
tells
us
that
he
then
lingered
abroad
for
some
time
after
his
ordination
elevation
edit
bede
implies
that
oswiu
decided
to
take
further
action
because
wilfrid
was
away
for
longer
than
expected
it
is
unclear
whether
oswiu
changed
his
mind
about
wilfrid
or
whether
he
despaired
of
his
return
or
whether
he
never
really
intended
him
to
become
bishop
but
used
this
opportunity
to
get
him
out
of
the
country
chad
was
invited
then
to
become
bishop
of
the
northumbrians
by
king
oswiu
chad
is
often
listed
as
a
bishop
of
york
bede
generally
uses
ethnic
not
geographical
designations
for
chad
and
other
early
anglo
saxon
bishops
however
at
this
point
he
does
also
refer
to
oswiu
s
desire
that
chad
become
bishop
of
the
church
in
york
york
later
became
the
diocesan
city
partly
because
it
had
already
been
designated
as
such
in
the
earlier
roman
sponsored
mission
of
paulinus
to
deira
so
it
is
not
clear
whether
bede
is
simply
echoing
the
practice
of
his
own
day
or
whether
oswiu
and
chad
were
considering
a
territorial
basis
and
a
see
for
his
episcopate
it
is
quite
clear
that
oswiu
intended
chad
to
be
bishop
over
the
entire
northumbrian
people
over
riding
the
claims
of
both
wilfrid
and
eata
chad
faced
the
same
problem
over
ordination
as
wilfrid
and
so
set
off
to
seek
ordination
amid
the
chaos
caused
by
the
plague
bede
tells
us
that
he
travelled
first
to
canterbury
where
he
found
that
archbishop
deusdedit
was
dead
and
his
replacement
was
still
awaited
bede
does
not
tell
us
why
chad
diverted
to
canterbury
the
journey
seems
pointless
since
the
archbishop
had
died
three
years
previously
which
must
have
been
well
known
in
northumbria
and
was
the
very
reason
wilfrid
had
to
go
abroad
the
most
obvious
reason
for
chad
s
tortuous
travels
would
be
that
he
was
also
on
a
diplomatic
mission
from
oswiu
seeking
to
build
an
encircling
alliance
around
mercia
which
was
rapidly
recovering
from
its
position
of
weakness
from
canterbury
he
travelled
to
wessex
where
he
was
ordained
by
bishop
wini
of
the
west
saxons
and
two
british
i
e
welsh
bishops
none
of
these
bishops
was
recognised
by
rome
bede
points
out
that
at
that
time
there
was
no
other
bishop
in
all
britain
canonically
ordained
except
wini
and
the
latter
had
been
installed
irregularly
by
the
king
of
the
west
saxons
bede
describes
chad
at
this
point
as
a
diligent
performer
in
deed
of
what
he
had
learnt
in
the
scriptures
should
be
done
bede
also
tells
us
that
chad
was
teaching
the
values
of
aidan
and
cedd
his
life
was
one
of
constant
travel
bede
says
that
chad
visited
continually
the
towns
countryside
cottages
villages
and
houses
to
preach
the
gospel
clearly
the
model
he
followed
was
one
of
the
bishop
as
prophet
or
missionary
basic
christian
rites
of
passage
baptism
and
confirmation
were
almost
always
performed
by
a
bishop
and
for
decades
to
come
they
were
generally
carried
out
in
mass
ceremonies
probably
with
little
systematic
instruction
or
counselling
removal
edit
in
666
wilfrid
returned
from
neustria
bringing
many
rules
of
catholic
observance
as
bede
says
he
found
chad
already
occupying
the
same
position
it
seems
that
he
did
not
in
fact
challenge
chad
s
pre
eminence
in
his
own
area
rather
he
would
have
worked
assiduously
to
build
up
his
own
support
in
sympathetic
monasteries
like
gilling
and
ripon
he
did
however
assert
his
episcopal
rank
by
going
into
mercia
and
even
kent
to
ordain
priests
bede
tells
us
that
the
net
effect
of
his
efforts
on
the
church
was
that
the
irish
monks
who
still
lived
in
northumbria
either
came
fully
into
line
with
catholic
practices
or
left
for
home
nevertheless
bede
cannot
conceal
that
oswiu
and
chad
had
broken
significantly
with
roman
practice
in
many
ways
and
that
the
church
in
northumbria
had
been
divided
by
the
ordination
of
rival
bishops
in
669
a
new
archbishop
of
canterbury
theodore
of
tarsus
sent
by
pope
vitalian
arrived
in
england
he
immediately
set
off
on
a
tour
of
the
country
tackling
abuses
of
which
he
had
been
forewarned
he
instructed
chad
to
step
down
and
wilfrid
to
take
over
15
according
to
bede
theodore
was
so
impressed
by
chad
s
show
of
humility
that
he
confirmed
his
ordination
as
bishop
while
insisting
he
step
down
from
his
position
chad
retired
gracefully
and
returned
to
his
post
as
abbot
of
lastingham
leaving
wilfrid
as
bishop
of
the
northumbrians
at
york
3
bishop
of
the
mercians
edit
recall
edit
later
that
same
year
king
wulfhere
of
mercia
requested
a
bishop
wulfhere
and
the
other
sons
of
penda
had
converted
to
christianity
although
penda
himself
had
remained
a
pagan
until
his
death
655
penda
had
allowed
bishops
to
operate
in
mercia
although
none
had
succeeded
in
establishing
the
church
securely
without
active
royal
support
archbishop
theodore
refused
to
consecrate
a
new
bishop
instead
he
recalled
chad
out
of
his
retirement
at
lastingham
according
to
bede
theodore
was
greatly
impressed
by
chad
s
humility
and
holiness
this
was
displayed
particularly
in
his
refusal
to
use
a
horse
he
insisted
on
walking
everywhere

his
regard

ordered
him
to
ride
on
long
journeys
and
went
so
far
as
to
lift
him
into
the
saddle
on
one
occasion
chad
was
consecrated
bishop
of
the
mercians
literally
frontier
people
and
of
the
lindsey
people
lindisfaras
bede
tells
us
that
chad
was
actually
the
third
bishop
sent
to
wulfhere
making
him
the
fifth
bishop
of
the
mercians
16
the
kingdom
of
lindsey
covering
the
north
eastern
area
of
modern
lincolnshire
was
under
mercian
control
although
it
had
in
the
past
sometimes
fallen
under
northumbrian
control
later
anglo
saxon
episcopal
lists
sometimes
add
the
middle
angles
to
his
responsibilities
17
they
were
a
distinct
part
of
the
mercian
kingdom
centred
on
the
middle
trent
and
lower
tame
the
area
around
tamworth
lichfield
and
repton
that
formed
the
core
of
the
wider
mercian
polity
it
was
their
sub
king
peada
who
had
secured
the
services
of
chad
s
brother
cedd
in
653
and
they
were
frequently
considered
separately
from
the
mercians
proper
a
people
who
lived
further
to
the
west
and
north
monastic
foundations
edit
when
chad
was
made
bishop
of
mercia
in
669
he
moved
his
see
from
repton
to
lichfield
possibly
because
this
was
already
a
holy
site
as
the
scene
of
martyrdoms
during
the
roman
period
wulfhere
donated
land
at
lichfield
for
chad
to
build
a
monastery
it
was
because
of
this
that
the
centre
of
the
diocese
of
mercia
ultimately
became
settled
at
lichfield
3
the
lichfield
monastery
was
probably
similar
to
that
at
lastingham
and
bede
makes
clear
that
it
was
partly
staffed
by
monks
from
lastingham
including
chad
s
faithful
retainer
owin
lichfield
was
very
close
to
the
old
roman
road
of
watling
street
the
main
route
across
mercia
and
a
short
distance
from
mercia
s
main
royal
centre
at
tamworth
it
was
because
of
this
that
the
ecclesiastical
centre
of
mercia
became
settled
as
the
diocese
of
lichfield
wulfhere
also
gave
chad
land
for
a
monastery
at
barrow
upon
humber
in
north
lincolnshire
he
traveled
about
on
foot
until
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
gave
him
a
horse
and
ordered
him
to
ride
it
at
least
on
long
journeys
18
chad
s
shrine
at
lichfield
was
destroyed
in
1538
wulfhere
also
donated
land
sufficient
for
fifty
families
at
a
place
in
lindsey
referred
to
by
bede
as
ad
barwae
this
is
probably
barrow
upon
humber
where
an
anglo
saxon
monastery
of
a
later
date
has
been
excavated
this
was
easily
reached
by
river
from
the
midlands
and
close
to
an
easy
crossing
of
the
river
humber
allowing
rapid
communication
along
surviving
roman
roads
with
lastingham
chad
remained
abbot
of
lastingham
throughout
his
life
as
well
as
heading
the
communities
at
both
lichfield
and
barrow
ministry
among
the
mercians
edit
chad
then
proceeded
to
carry
out
much
missionary
and
pastoral
work
within
the
kingdom
bede
tells
us
that
chad
governed
the
bishopric
of
the
mercians
and
of
the
people
of
lindsey
in
the
manner
of
the
ancient
fathers
and
in
great
perfection
of
life
however
bede
gives
little
concrete
information
about
the
work
of
chad
in
mercia
implying
that
in
style
and
substance
it
was
a
continuation
of
what
he
had
done
in
northumbria
the
area
he
covered
was
very
large
stretching
across
england
from
coast
to
coast
it
was
also
in
many
places
difficult
terrain
with
woodland
heath
and
mountain
over
much
of
the
centre
and
large
areas
of
marshland
to
the
east
bede
does
tell
us
that
chad
built
for
himself
a
small
house
at
lichfield
a
short
distance
from
the
church
sufficient
to
hold
his
core
of
seven
or
eight
disciples
who
gathered
to
pray
and
study
with
him
there
when
he
was
not
out
on
business
chad
worked
in
mercia
and
lindsey
for
only
two
years
before
he
too
died
during
a
plague
19
yet
st
bede
could
write
in
a
letter
that
mercia
came
to
the
faith
and
essex
was
recovered
for
it
by
the
two
brothers
cedd
and
chad
in
other
words
bede
considered
that
chad
s
two
years
as
bishop
were
decisive
in
christianising
mercia
death
edit
chad
died
on
2
march
672
and
was
buried
at
the
church
of
saint
mary
which
later
became
part
of
the
cathedral
at
lichfield
bede
relates
the
death
story
as
that
of
a
man
who
was
already
regarded
as
a
saint
bede
has
stressed
throughout
his
narrative
that
chad
s
holiness
communicated
across
boundaries
of
culture
and
politics
to
theodore
for
example
in
his
own
lifetime
the
death
story
is
clearly
of
supreme
importance
to
bede
confirming
chad
s
holiness
and
vindicating
his
life
the
account
occupies
considerably
more
space
in
bede
s
account
than
all
the
rest
of
chad
s
ministry
in
northumbria
and
mercia
together
bede
noted
that
owin
was
working
outside
the
oratory
at
lichfield
inside
chad
studied
alone
because
the
other
monks
were
at
worship
in
the
church
suddenly
owin
heard
the
sound
of
joyful
singing
coming
from
heaven
at
first
to
the
south
east
but
gradually
coming
closer
until
it
filled
the
roof
of
the
oratory
itself
then
there
was
silence
for
half
an
hour
followed
by
the
same
singing
going
back
the
way
it
had
come
owin
at
first
did
nothing
but
about
an
hour
later
chad
called
him
in
and
told
him
to
fetch
the
seven
brothers
from
the
church
chad
gave
his
final
address
to
the
brothers
urging
them
to
keep
the
monastic
discipline
they
had
learnt
only
after
this
did
he
tell
them
that
he
knew
his
own
death
was
near
speaking
of
death
as
that
friendly
guest
who
is
used
to
visiting
the
brethren
he
asked
them
to
pray
then
blessed
and
dismissed
them
the
brothers
left
sad
and
downcast
owin
returned
a
little
later
and
saw
chad
privately
he
asked
about
the
singing
chad
told
him
that
he
must
keep
it
to
himself
for
the
time
being
angels
had
come
to
call
him
to
his
heavenly
reward
and
in
seven
days
they
would
return
to
fetch
him
so
it
was
that
chad
weakened
and
died
after
seven
days
on
2
march
which
remains
his
feast
day
bede
wrote
that
he
had
always
looked
forward
to
this
day
or
rather
his
mind
had
always
been
on
the
day
of
the
lord
many
years
later
his
old
friend
egbert
told
a
visitor
that
someone
in
ireland
had
seen
the
heavenly
company
coming
for
chad
s
soul
and
returning
with
it
to
heaven
significantly
with
the
heavenly
host
was
cedd
bede
was
not
sure
whether
or
not
the
vision
was
actually
egbert
s
own
bede
s
account
of
chad
s
death
strongly
confirms
the
main
themes
of
his
life
primarily
he
was
a
monastic
leader
deeply
involved
in
the
fairly
small
communities
of
loyal
monks
who
formed
his
mission
teams
his
brothers
his
consciousness
was
strongly
eschatological
focussed
on
the
last
things
and
their
significance
finally
he
was
inextricably
linked
with
cedd
and
his
other
brothers
cult
and
relics

chad
is
considered
a
saint
in
the
roman
catholic
20
the
anglican
churches
the
celtic
orthodox
church
and
is
also
noted
as
a

his
feast
day

celebrated
on
2

according
to
st
bede
chad
was
venerated
as
a
saint
immediately
after
his
death
and
his
relics
were
translated
to
a
new
shrine
he
remained
the
centre
of
an
important
cult
focused
on
healing
throughout
the
middle
ages
the
cult
had
twin
foci
his
tomb
in

directly
behind
the

more
particularly
his
skull
kept
in

prebendary
arthur

probably
a

set
these
were
eventually
passed
to
his
nieces
bridget
and
katherine
dudley
of
russells
hall
in
1651
they
reappeared
when
a
farmer
henry
hodgetts
of
sedgley
was
on
his
death
bed
and
kept
praying
to
st
chad
when
the
priest
hearing
his

confession

asked
him
why
he
called
upon
chad
henry

bones
are

he
instructed
his
wife
to
give
the
relics
to
the
priest
whence
they
found
their
way
to
the
seminary
at
st
omer
in
france
after
the
conclusion
of
penal
times
in
the
early
19th
century

found
their
way
into

of

and
all
but
one
of
the
bones
which
