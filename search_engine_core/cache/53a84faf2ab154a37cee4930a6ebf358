contentssuperphosphatesuperphosphate
is
a
chemical
fertiliser
first
synthesised
in
the
1840s
by
reacting
bones
with
sulfuric
acid
the
process
was
subsequently
improved
by
reacting
phosphate
coprolites
with
sulfuric
acid
subsequently
other
phosphate
rich
deposits
such
as
phosphorite
were
discovered
and
used
soluble
phosphate
is
an
essential
nutrient
for
all
plants
and
the

superphosphate
revolutionised
agricultural
productivity
history
edit
the
earliest
phosphate
rich
fertilisers
were
made
from
guano
animal
manure
or
crushed
bones
1
so
valuable
were
these
resources
during
the
industrial
revolution
that
graveyards
and
catacombs
across
europe
were
pillaged
for
human
bones
to
satisfy
demand
1
in
1842
the
reverend
john
stevens
henslow
found
coprolites
fossilised
dinosaur
dung
in
the
cliffs
of
south
suffolk
in
england
he
was
aware
of
previous
research
in
dorset
by
william
buckland
which
showed
that
coprolites
were
rich
in
phosphate
which
could
be
made
available
for
plants
by
dissolution
in
sulfuric
acid
john
bennet
lawes
who
farmed
in
hertfordshire
learnt
of
these
discoveries
and
conducted
his
own
research
at
his
farm
at
rothamsted
later
an
agricultural
research
station
and
named
his
resultant
product
super
phosphate
of
lime
2
he
patented
the
discovery
and
in
1842
started
producing
superphosphate
from
fossilised
dinosaur
dung
on
an
industrial
scale
this
was
the
first
chemical
manure
produced
in
the
world
1
edward
packard
recognising
the
significance
of
lawes
work
converted
a
mill
in
ipswich
to
produce
this
new
fertiliser
from
coprolites
excavated
in
the
village
of
kirton
he
moved
his
operation
in
the
1850s
to
bramford
next
to
a
similar
new
factory
operated
by
joseph
fisons
these
operations
were
subsequently
destined
to
form
part
of
the
fisons
fertiliser
company
the
street
where
the
original
mill
stood
is
still
called
coprolite
street

agricultural
significance
edit
all
plants
and
animals
need
phosphorus
compounds
to
carry
out
their
normal
metabolism
even
though
in
the
case
of
plants
it
may
constitute
as
little
as
2
of
their
dry
matter
4
the
phosphorus
can
be
in
the
form
of
soluble
inorganic
phosphates
or
organic
compounds
containing
phosphorus
in
the
living
cell
energy
is
accumulated
or
expended
using
a
complex
range
of
biochemical
processes
which
involve
the
transformation
of
adenosine
triphosphate
to
adenosine
diphosphate
when
energy
is
being
expended
and
the
reverse
when
energy
is
being
accumulated
as
in
photosynthesis
5
superphosphate
is
relatively
cheap
6
compared
to
other
available
sources
of
phosphate
the
lower
price
contributes
to
its
widespread
adoption
particularly
in
developing
regions
where
the
costs
of
agricultural
inputs
are
a
significant
consideration
7
the
fate
of
phosphates
in
soil
is
complicated
as
they
readily
form
complexes
with
other
minerals
such
as
clays
and
aluminium
and
iron
salts
4
and
may
be
generally
unavailable
to
plants
except
by
weathering
and
through
the
action
of
bacterial
and
the
soil
microbiome
4
the
advantage
of
superphosphate
fertilisers
is
that
a
significant
proportion
of
the
phosphate
content
is
soluble
and
is
immediately
available
to
plants
it
thus
provides
a
very
quick
boost
to
plant
growth
however
the
complex
soil
dynamics
tend
to
immobilize
phosphate
in
mineral
complexes
or
organic
ligands
reducing
the
availability
to
plants
phosphates
are
also
lost
to
the
soil
and
plant
environment
when
crops
are
harvested
or
consumed
by
animals
or
otherwise
lost
to
the
local
system
phosphates
tend
to
be
tightly
bound
to
fine
sediments
in
the
soil
8
leaching
of
sediments
from
soil
can
lead
to
elevated
phosphate
concentrations
in
the
receiving
watercourse
9
the
addition
of
phosphorus
as
super
phosphate
enables
much
greater
crop
yields
4
although
there
is
some
replenishment
of
soil
phosphorus
from
mineral
sources
and
release
from
soil
complexes
by
physical
and
biological
mechanisms
the
rate
of
re
solubilisation
is
too
low
to
support
modern
agricultural
productivity
organic
phosphorus
contained
within
plant
or
animal
matter
is
much
more
readily
re
solubilised
as
the
material
decomposes
through
microbial
action
4
however
the
key
quality
that
made
superphosphate
so
attractive
the
solubility
of
the
phosphate
also
created
an
ongoing
demand
for
the
product
as
the
soluble
phosphorus
salts
and
phosphate
bound
to
fine
sediments
are
eluted
from
fields
into
rivers
and
streams
where
they
became
lost
to
agriculture
10
but
help
to
encourage
unwelcome
eutrophication

manufacture
edit
superphosphates
are
manufactured
in
all
the
main
industrial
centres
of
the
world
including
europe
china
and
the
us
11
in
2021
about
689
916
tonnes
of
superphosphate
were
produced
with
more
than
half
from
poland
and
substantial
amounts
from
indonesia
bangladesh
china
and
japan
12
formulations
edit
all
formulations
of
superphosphate
contain
a
significant
proportion
of
soluble
and
available
phosphate
ions
which
is
the
key
quality
that
has
made
them
essential
for
modern
agriculture
7
single
superphosphate
edit
single
superphosphate
is
produced
using
the
traditional
method
of
extraction
of
phosphate
rock
with
sulfuric
acid
an
approximate
1
1
mixture
of
ca
h2po4
2
and
caso4
13
double
superphosphate
edit
the
term
double
superphosphate
refers
to
a
mixture
of
triple
and
single
superphosphate
resulting
from
the
extraction
of
phosphate
rock
with
a
mixture
of
phosphoric
and
sulfuric
acids
13
triple
superphosphate
edit
triple
superphosphate
is
a
component
of
many
proprietary
fertilisers
it
primarily
consists
of
monocalcium
phosphate
ca
h2po4
2
it
is
obtained
by
treating
phosphate
rock
with
phosphoric
acid
many
proprietary
fertilisers
are
derived
from
triple
superphosphate
for
example
by
blending
with
ammonium
sulfate
and
potassium
chloride

adverse
impacts
of
superphosphate
edit
continuous
use
of
superphosphate
can
lead
to
soil
acidification
particularly
on
poorly
buffered
soils
altering
ph
levels
and
potentially
limiting
nutrient
availability
14
this
necessitates
careful
monitoring
and
management
of
soil
ph
to
prevent
long
term
soil
degradation
15
production
and
transport
produce
significant
quantities
of
co2
amounting
in
some
estimates
to
1
2kg
kg
for
the
manufacture
of
superphosphate
and
238
g
kg
for
transport
16
other
sources
note
that
assuming
all
the
sulfur
for
the
sulfuric
acid
is
recovered
from
oil
and
gas
sweetening
17
and
the
reaction
to
produce
superphosphate
is
exothermic
provided
that
the
heat
generated
is
fully
re
used
the
whole
cycle
may
have
a
negative
carbon
footprint
as
low
as
518
g
kg
for
production
alone
16
while
superphosphate
enriches
soil
with
phosphorus
excessive
or
imbalanced
application
can
disrupt
nutrient
ratios
leading
to
deficiencies
or
toxicities
in
plants
evidence
is
emerging
that
elevated
levels
may
be
associated
with
deadly
infections
by
phytophthora
cinnamomi
18
sustainable
fertilisation
practices
including
soil
testing
and
targeted
applications
are
essential
to
mitigate
this
risk
19
the
availability
of
suitable
phosphate
rich
rocks
is
limited
and
estimates
of
peak
phosphorus
vary
between
30
years
from
2022
20
or
somewhere
between
2051
and
2092
21
as
the
human
population
increases
and
the
demand
for
food
increases
the
availability
of
superphosphate
fertilisers
in
the
future
may
be
less
secure
suggesting
that
alternative
sources
of
phosphate
may
need
to
be
developed
10
a
significant
number
of
plants
especially
those
that
evolved
in
gondwanaland
have
a
sensitivity
to
excess
phosphorus
18
getting
all
that
they
need
from
associations
with
arbuscular
mycorrhiza
examples
of
plants
that
are
intolerant
of
the
application
of
superphosphate
include
hakea
prostrata
and
grevillea
crithmifolia
many
terrestrial
orchids
which
rely
on
mycorrhizal
associations
may
have
similar
sensitivities
to
elevated
phosphate
levels
22
and
populations
may
be
suppressed
by
applications
of
superphosphate
containing
fertiliser
23
eutrophication
of
rivers
lakes
and
the
sea
has
a
very
well
documented
link
to
increasing
phosphate
concentrations
however
teasing
out
the
contribution
made
to
this
problem
by
the
use
of
superphosphate
is
difficult
because
of
the
wide
range
of
other
sources
of
phosphorus
compounds
in
both
human
and
animal
waste
streams
recent
issues
on
the
river
wye
have
been
traced
back
to
intensive
poultry
rearing
with
the
excess
phosphate
coming
from
poorly
managed
chicken
manure
