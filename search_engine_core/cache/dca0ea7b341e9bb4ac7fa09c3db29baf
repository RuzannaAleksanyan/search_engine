gothic
architecture
english
gothic
is
an
architectural
style
that
flourished
from
the
late
12th
until
the
mid
17th
century
1
2
the
style
was
most
prominently
used
in
the
construction
of
cathedrals
and
churches
gothic
architecture
s
defining
features
are
pointed
arches
rib
vaults
buttresses
and
extensive
use
of
stained
glass
combined
these
features
allowed
the
creation
of
buildings
of
unprecedented
height
and
grandeur
filled
with
light
from
large
stained
glass
windows
important
examples
include
westminster
abbey
canterbury
cathedral
and
salisbury
cathedral
the
gothic
style
endured
in
england
much
longer
than
in
continental
europe
the
gothic
style
was
introduced
from
france
where
the
various
elements
had
first
been
used
together
within
a
single
building
at
the
choir
of
the
abbey
of
saint
denis
north
of
paris
completed
in
1144
3
the
earliest
large
scale
applications
of
gothic
architecture
in
england
were
canterbury
cathedral
and
westminster
abbey
many
features
of
gothic
architecture
had
evolved
naturally
from
romanesque
architecture
often
known
in
england
as
norman
architecture
the
first
cathedral
in
england
to
be
both
planned
and
built
entirely
in
the
gothic
style
was
wells
cathedral
begun
in
1175
4
other
features
were
imported
from
the
ile
de
france
where
the
first
french
gothic
cathedral
sens
cathedral
had
been
built
1135
64
5
after
a
fire
destroyed
the
choir
of
canterbury
cathedral
in
1174
the
french
architect
william
of
sens
rebuilt
the
choir
in
the
new
gothic
style
between
1175
and
1180
the
transition
can
also
be
seen
at
durham
cathedral
a
norman
building
which
was
remodelled
with
the
earliest
rib
vault
known
besides
cathedrals
monasteries
and
parish
churches
the
style
was
used
for
many
secular
buildings
including
university
buildings
palaces
great
houses
and
almshouses
and
guildhalls
stylistic
periodisations
of
the
english
gothic
style
are
the
architect
and
art
historian
thomas
rickman
s
attempt
to
discriminate
the
style
of
architecture
in
england
first
published
in
1812
divided
gothic
architecture
in
the
british
isles
into
three
stylistic
periods
8
rickman
identified
the
period
of
architecture
as
follows
from
the
15th
century
under
the
house
of
tudor
the
prevailing
gothic
style
is
commonly
known
as
tudor
architecture
this
style
is
ultimately
succeeded
by
elizabethan
architecture
and
renaissance
architecture
under
elizabeth
i
r
1558
1603

rickman
excluded
from
his
scheme
most
new
buildings
after
henry
viii
s
reign
calling
the
style
of
additions
and
rebuilding
in
the
later
16th
and
earlier
17th
centuries
often
much
debased
8
architect
and
art
historian
edmund
sharpe
in
the
seven
periods
of
english
architecture
1851
identified
a
pre
gothic
transitional
period
1145
90
following
the
norman
period
in
which
pointed
arches
and
round
arches
were
employed
together
10
focusing
on
the
windows
sharpe
dubbed
rickman
s
gothic
styles
as
follows
in
the
english
renaissance
the
stylistic
language
of
the
ancient
classical
orders
and
the
renaissance
architecture
of
southern
europe
began
to
supplant
gothic
architecture
in
continental
europe
but
the
british
isles
continued
to
favour
gothic
building
styles
with
traditional
perpendicular
gothic
building
projects
undertaken
into
the
17th
century
in
england
and
both
elizabethan
and
jacobean
architecture
incorporating
gothic
features
particularly
for
churches
11
classical
inspired
architecture
predominated
after
the
great
fire
of
london
the
rebuilding
of
the
city
of
london
was
so
extensive
that
the
numbers
of
workers
employed
broke
the
monopoly
of
the
medieval
livery
company
of
stonemasons
and
the
worshipful
company
of
masons
and
the
role
of
master
mason
was
displaced
by
that
of
the
early
modern
architect
11
the
new
st
paul
s
cathedral
designed
by
christopher
wren
and
his
wren
churches
mostly
dispensed
with
the
gothic
idiom
in
favour
of
classical
work
11
outside
london
however
new
ecclesiastical
buildings
and
repairs
to
older
churches
were
still
carried
out
in
gothic
style
particularly
near
the
ancient
university
towns
of
oxford
and
cambridge
where
the
university
colleges
were
important
patrons
of
17th
century
gothic
construction
11
by
the
18th
century
architects
occasionally
worked
in
gothic
style
but
the
living
tradition
of
gothic
workmanship
had
faded
and
their
designs
rarely
resembled
medieval
gothic
buildings
only
when
the
gothic
revival
movement
of
the
late
18th
and
19th
centuries
began
was
the
architectural
language
of
medieval
gothic
relearned
through
the
scholarly
efforts
of
early
19th
century
art
historians
like
rickman
and
matthew
bloxam
whose
principles
of
gothic
ecclesiastical
architecture
first
appeared
in
1829
12
11
alongside
the
new
gothic
building
work
of
the
19th
century
many
of
england
s
existing
gothic
buildings
were
extensively
repaired
restored
remodelled
and
rebuilt
by
architects
seeking
to
improve
the
buildings
according
to
the
romantic
high
church
aesthetic
of
the
oxford
movement
and
to
replace
many
of
the
medieval
features
lost
in
the
iconoclastic
phases
of
the
reformation
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
and
the
wars
of
the
three
kingdoms
in
the
process
of
this
victorian
restoration
much
of
the
original
gothic
architecture
of
the
middle
ages
was
lost
or
altered
beyond
recognition
however
medieval
works
left
unfinished
were
often
completed
or
restored
to
their
original
designs
according
to
james
stevens
curl
the
revival
of
gothic
architecture
was
arguably
the
most
influential
artistic
phenomenon
ever
to
spring
from
england
11
the
various
english
gothic
styles
are
seen
at
their
most
fully
developed
in
cathedrals
monasteries
and
collegiate
churches
with
the
exception
of
salisbury
cathedral
english
cathedrals
having
building
dates
that
typically
range
over
400
years

great
stylistic
diversity

it
succeeded
norman
architecture
which
had
introduced
early
great
cathedrals
built
of
stone
instead
of
timber
and
saw
the
construction
of
remarkable
abbeys
throughout
england
the
normans
had
introduced
the
three
classical
orders
of
architecture
and
created
massive
walls
for
their
buildings
with
thin
pilaster
like
buttresses
the
transition
from
norman
to
gothic
lasted
from
about
1145
until
1190
in
the
reigns
of
king
stephen
and
richard
i
the
style
changed
from
the
more
massive
severe
norman
style
to
the
more
delicate
and
refined
gothic
16
early
english
was
particularly
influenced
by
what
was
called
in
english
the
french
style
citation
needed
the
style
was
imported
from
caen
in
normandy
by
french
norman
architects
who
also
imported
cut
stones
from
normandy
for
their
construction
it
was
also
influenced
by
the
architecture
of
the
ile
de
france
where
sens
cathedral
had
been
constructed
the
first
gothic
cathedral
in
france
the
chancel
of
canterbury
cathedral
one
of
the
first
early
english
structures
in
england
was
rebuilt
in
the
new
style
by
a
french
architect
william
of
sens
17
the
early
english
style
particularly
featured
more
strongly
constructed
walls
with
stone
vaulted
roofs
to
resist
fire
the
weight
of
these
vaults
was
carried
downwards
and
outwards
by
arched
ribs
this
feature
the
early
rib
vault
was
used
at
durham
cathedral
the
first
time
it
was
used
this
way
in
europe
18
another
important
innovation
introduced
in
this
early
period
was
the
buttress
a
stone
column
outside
the
structure
that
reinforced
the
walls
against
the
weight
pressing
outward
and
downward
from
the
vaults
this
evolved
into
the
flying
buttress
which
carried
the
thrust
from
the
wall
of
the
nave
over
the
roof
of
the
aisle
the
buttress
was
given
further
support
by
a
heavy
stone
pinnacle
buttresses
were
an
early
feature
of
the
chapter
house
of
lichfield
cathedral
16
early
english
is
typified
by
lancet
windows
tall
narrow
lights
topped
by
a
pointed
arch
they
were
grouped
together
side
by
side
under
a
single
arch
and
decorated
with
mullions
in
tracery
patterns
such
as
cusps
or
spear
points
lancet
windows
were
combined
similarly
pointed
arches
and
the
ribs
of
the
vaults
overhead
giving
a
harmonious
and
unified
style

late

centuries
edit
the
second
style
of
english
gothic
architecture
is
generally
termed
decorated
gothic
because
the
amount
of
ornament
and
decoration
increased
dramatically
it
corresponded
roughly
with
the
rayonnant
period
in
france
which
influenced
it
it
was
a
period
of
growing
prosperity
in
england
and
this
was
expressed
in
the
decoration
of
gothic
buildings
almost
every
feature
of
the
interiors
and
facades
was
decorated
historians
sometimes
subdivide
this
style
into
two
periods
based
on
the
predominant
motifs
of
the
designs
the
first
the
geometric
style
lasted
from
about
1245
or
50
until
1315
or
1360
where
ornament
tended
to
be
based
on
straight
lines
cubes
and
circles
followed
by
the
curvilinear
style
from
about
1290
or
1315
until
1350
or
1360
which
used
gracefully
curving
lines
22
additions
in
the
decorated
style
were
often
added
to
earlier
cathedrals
one
striking
example
is
found
at
ely
cathedral
the
architect
thomas
witney
built
the
central
tower
from
1315
to
1322
in
decorated
style
soon
afterwards
another
architect
william
joy
added
curving
arches
to
strengthen
the
structure
and
made
further
extensions
to
join
the
lady
chapel
to
the
choir
in
1329
45
he
created
an
extraordinary
double
arch
in
the
decorated
style

edit
the
buttress
became
more
common
in
this
period
as
at
lichfield
cathedral
these
were
stone
columns
outside
the
walls
which
supports
them
allowing
thinner
and
high
walls
between
the
buttresses
and
larger
windows
the
buttresses
were
often
topped
by
ornamental
stone
pinnacles
to
give
them
greater
weight

edit
perpendicular
gothic
late
13th
to
mid
16th
century
edit
the
perpendicular
gothic
or
simply
perpendicular
is
the
third
and
final
style
of
medieval
gothic
architecture
in
england
it
is
characterised
by
an
emphasis
on
vertical
lines
and
is
sometimes
called
rectilinear
26
27
the
perpendicular
style
began
to
emerge
in
about
1330
the
earliest
example
is
the
chapter
house
of
old
st
paul
s
cathedral
built
by
the
royal
architect
william
de
ramsey
in
1332
28
the
early
style
was
also
practised
by
another
royal
architect
john
sponlee
and
fully
developed
in
the
works
of
henry
yevele
and
william
wynford
walls
were
built
much
higher
than
in
earlier
periods
and
stained
glass
windows
became
very
large
so
that
the
space
around
them
was
reduced
to
simple
piers
horizontal
transoms
sometimes
had
to
be
introduced
to
strengthen
the
vertical
mullions
29
many
churches
were
built
with
magnificent
towers
including
york
minster
gloucester
cathedral
worcester
cathedral
and
st
botolph
s
church
boston
st
giles
church
wrexham
st
mary
magdalene
taunton
another
outstanding
example
of
perpendicular
is
king
s
college
chapel
cambridge
30
the
interiors
of
perpendicular
churches
were
filled
with
lavish
ornamental
woodwork
including
misericords
choir
stalls
with
lifting
seats
under
which
were
grotesque
carvings
stylized
poppy
heads
or
carved
figures
in
foliage
on
the
ends
of
benches
and
elaborate
multicoloured
decoration
usually
in
floral
patterns
on
panels
or
cornices
called
brattishing
29
the
sinuous
lines
of
the
tracery
in
the
decorated
style
were
replaced
by
more
geometric
forms
and
perpendicular
lines
31
the
style
was
also
affected
by
the
tragic
history
of
the
period
particularly
the
black
death
which
killed
an
estimated
third
of
england
s
population
in
18
months
between
june
1348
and
december
1349
and
returned
in
1361
62
to
kill
another
fifth
this
had
a
great
effect
on
the
arts
and
culture
which
took
a
more
sober
direction
32
the
perpendicular
gothic
was
the
longest
of
the
english
gothic
periods
it
continued
for
a
century
after
the
style
had
nearly
disappeared
from
france
and
the
rest
of
the
european
continent
where
the
renaissance
had
already
begun
gradually
near
the
end
of
the
period
renaissance
forms
began
to
appear
in
the
english
gothic
a
rood
screen
a
renaissance
ornament
was
installed
in
the
chapel
of
king
s
college
chapel
cambridge
during
the
elizabethan
period
1558
1603
the
classical
details
including
the
five
orders
of
classical
architecture
were
gradually
introduced
carved
ornament
with
italian
renaissance
motifs
began
to
be
used
in
decoration
including
on
the
tomb
of
henry
vii
in
westminster
abbey
the
pointed
arch
gradually
gave
way
to
the
roman
rounded
arch
brick
began
to
replace
masonry
the
roof
construction
was
concealed
and
the
gothic
finally
gave
way
to
an
imitation
of
roman
and
greek
styles

characteristics
edit
examples
edit
roofs
edit
the
pitched
gothic
timber
roof
was
a
distinctive
feature
of
the
style
both
in
religious
and
domestic
architecture
it
had
to
be
able
to
resist
rain
snow
and
high
winds
of
the
english
climate
and
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
structure
a
pitched
roof
was
a
common
feature
of
all
the
gothic
periods
during
the
norman
period
the
roofs
normally
were
pitched
forty
five
degrees
with
the
apex
forming
a
right
angle
which
harmonised
with
the
rounded
arches
of
the
gables
with
the
arrival
of
the
pointed
rib
vault
the
roofs
became
steeper
up
to
sixty
degrees
in
the
late
perpendicular
period
the
angle
declined
to
twenty
degrees
or
even
less
the
roofs
were
usually
made
of
boards
overlaid
with
tiles
or
sheet
lead
which
was
commonly
used
on
low
pitched
roofs
36
the
simpler
gothic
roofs
were
supported
by
long
rafters
of
light
wood
resting
on
wooden
trusses
set
into
the
walls
the
rafters
were
supported
by
more
solid
beams
called
purlins
which
were
carried
at
their
ends
by
the
roof
trusses
the
tie
beam
is
the
chief
beam
of
the
truss
later
the
roof
was
supported
by
structures
called
a
king
point
truss
and
queen
post
truss
where
the
principal
rafters
are
connected
with
the
tie
beam
by
the
head
of
the
truss
the
king
point
truss
has
a
vertical
beam
with
connects
the
centre
of
the
rafter
to
the
ridge
of
the
roof
supported
by
diagonal
struts
while
a
queen
post
truss
has
a
wooden
collar
below
the
pointed
arch
which
united
the
posts
and
was
supported
by
struts
and
cross
braces
a
queen
post
truss
could
span
a
width
of
forty
feet
both
of
these
forms
created
greater
stability
but
the
full
weight
of
the
roof
still
came
down
directly
onto
the
walls
36
gothic
architects
did
not
like
the
roof
truss
systems
because
the
numerous
horizontal
beams
crossing
the
nave
obstructed
the
view
of
the
soaring
height
they
came
up
with
an
ingenious
solution
the
hammerbeam
roof
in
this
system
the
point
of
the
roof
is
supported
by
the
collar
and
trusses
but
from
the
collar
curved
beams
reach
well
downward
on
the
walls
and
carry
the
weight
downward
and
outwards
to
the
walls
and
buttresses
without
obstructing
the
view
the
oldest
existing
roof
of
this
kind
is
found
in
winchester
cathedral
the
most
famous
example
of
the
hammerbeam
roof
is
the
roof
of
westminster
hall
1395
the
largest
timber
roof
of
its
time
built
for
royal
ceremonies
such
as
the
banquets
following
the
coronation
of
the
king
other
notable
wooden
roofs
included
those
of
christ
church
oxford
trinity
college
cambridge
and
crosby
hall
a
similar
system
with
arched
trusses
was
used
in
the
roof
of
wexham
cathedral

university
gothic
edit
the
gothic
style
was
adopted
in
the
late
13th
to
15th
centuries
in
early
english
university
buildings
due
in
part
to
the
close
connection
between
the
universities
and
the
church
the
oldest
existing
example
of
university
gothic
in
england
is
probably
the
mob
quad
of
merton
college
oxford
constructed
between
1288
and
1378
