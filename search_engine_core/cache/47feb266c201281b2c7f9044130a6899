the
english
civil
war
refers
to
a
series
of
civil
wars
and
political
machinations
between
royalists
and
parliamentarians
in
the
kingdom
of
england
b
from
1642
to
1651
part
of
the
wider
1639
to
1653
wars
of
the
three
kingdoms
the
struggle
consisted
of
the
first
english
civil
war
and
the
second
english
civil
war
the
anglo
scottish
war
of
1650
to
1652
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
third
english
civil
war
while
the
conflicts
in
the
three
kingdoms
of
england
scotland
and
ireland
had
similarities
each
had
their
own
specific
issues
and
objectives
the
first
english
civil
war
was
fought
primarily
over
the
correct
balance
of
power
between
parliament
and
charles
i
it
ended
in
june
1646
with
royalist
defeat
and
the
king
in
custody
however
victory
exposed
parliamentarian
divisions
over
the
nature
of
the
political
settlement
the
vast
majority
went
to
war
in
1642
to
assert
parliament
s
right
to
participate
in
government
not
abolish
the
monarchy
which
meant
charles
refusal
to
make
concessions
led
to
a
stalemate
concern
over
the
political
influence
of
radicals
within
the
new
model
army
like
oliver
cromwell
led
to
an
alliance
between
moderate
parliamentarians
and
royalists
supported
by
the
covenanters
royalist
defeat
in
the
1648
second
english
civil
war
resulted
in
the
execution
of
charles
i
in
january
1649
and
establishment
of
the
commonwealth
of
england
in
1650
charles
ii
was
crowned
king
of
scotland
in
return
for
agreeing
to
create
a
presbyterian
church
in
both
england
and
scotland
the
subsequent
anglo
scottish
war
ended
with
parliamentarian
victory
at
worcester
on
3
september
1651
both
ireland

scotland
were
incorporated

terminology
edit
the
term
english
civil
war
appears
most
often
in
the
singular
but
historians
often
divide
the
conflict
into
two
or
three
separate
wars
they
were
not
restricted
to
england
alone
as
wales
having
been
annexed
into
the
kingdom
of
england
was
affected
by
the
same
political
instabilities
the
conflicts
also
involved
wars
with
scotland
and
ireland
and
civil
wars
within
them
some
historians
have
favoured
the
term
the
british
civil
wars
from
the
restoration
to
the
19th
century
the
common
phrase
for
the
civil
wars
was
the
rebellion
or
the
great
rebellion

the
wars
spanning
all
four
countries
are
known
as
the
wars

19th
century
sir
walter
scott
referred
to
it
as
the
great

the

background
edit
the
king
s
rule
edit
the
english
civil
war
broke
out
in
1642
less
than
40
years
after
the
death
of
queen
elizabeth
i
elizabeth
had
been
succeeded
by
her
first
cousin
twice
removed
king
james
vi
of
scotland
as
james
i
of
england
creating
the
first
personal
union
of
the
scottish
and
english
kingdoms
c
as
king
of
scots
james
had
become
accustomed
to
scotland
s
weak
parliamentary
tradition
since
assuming
control
of
the
scottish
government
in
1583
so
that
upon
assuming
power
south
of
the
border
the
new
king
of
england
was
affronted
by
the
constraints
the
english
parliament
attempted
to
place
on
him
in
exchange
for
money
consequently
james
s
personal
extravagance
which
resulted
in
his
being
perennially
short
of
money
meant
that
he
had
to
resort
to
extra
parliamentary
sources
of
income
moreover
increasing
inflation
during
this
period
meant
that
even
though
parliament
was
granting
the
king
the
same
nominal
value
of
subsidy
the
income
was
actually
worth
less
15
this
extravagance
was
tempered
by
james
s
peaceful
disposition
so
that
by
the
succession
of
his
son
charles
i
in
1625
the
two
kingdoms
had
both
experienced
relative
peace
internally
and
in
their
relations
with
each
other
charles
followed
his
father
s
dream
in
hoping
to
unite
the
kingdoms
of
england
scotland
and
ireland
into
a
single
kingdom
16
many
english
parliamentarians
were
suspicious
of
such
a
move
fearing
that
such
a
new
kingdom
might
destroy
old
english
traditions
that
had
bound
the
english
monarchy
clarification
needed
because
james
had
described
kings
as
little
gods
on
earth
chosen
by
god
to
rule
in
accordance
with
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
and
charles
shared
his
father
s
position
the
suspicions
of
the
parliamentarians
had
some
justification
17
parliament
in
an
english
constitutional
framework
edit
at
the
time
the
parliament
of
england
did
not
have
a
large
permanent
role
in
the
english
system
of
government
instead
it
functioned
as
a
temporary
advisory
committee
and
was
summoned
only
if
and
when
the
monarch
saw
fit
once
summoned
a
parliament
s
continued
existence
was
at
the
king
s
pleasure
since
it
was
subject
to
dissolution
by
him
at
any
time
yet
in
spite
of
this
limited
role
parliament
had
acquired
over
the
centuries
de
facto
powers
of
enough
significance
that
monarchs
could
not
simply
ignore
them
indefinitely
for
a
monarch
parliament
s
most
indispensable
power
was
its
ability
to
raise
tax
revenues
far
in
excess
of
all
other
sources
of
revenue
at
the
crown
s
disposal
by
the
17th
century
parliament
s
tax
raising
powers
had
come
to
be
derived
from
the
fact
that
the
gentry
was
the
only
stratum
of
society
with
the
ability
and
authority
to
collect
and
remit
the
most
meaningful
forms
of
taxation
then
available
at
the
local
level
so
if
the
king
wanted
to
ensure
smooth
revenue
collection
he
needed
the
gentry
s
cooperation
for
all
of
the
crown
s
legal
authority
its
resources
were
limited
by
any
modern
standard
to
the
extent
that
if
the
gentry
refused
to
collect
the
king
s
taxes
on
a
national
scale
the
crown
lacked
a
practical
means
of
compelling
them
from
the
thirteenth
century
monarchs
ordered
the
election
of
representatives
to
sit
in
the
house
of
commons
with
most
voters
being
the
owners
of
property
although
in
some
potwalloper
boroughs
every
male
householder
could
vote
when
assembled
along
with
the
house
of
lords
these
elected
representatives
formed
a
parliament
so
the
concept
of
parliaments
allowed
representatives
of
the
property
owning
class
to
meet
primarily
at
least
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
monarch
to
sanction
whatever
taxes
the
monarch
wished
to
collect
in
the
process
the
representatives
could
debate
and
enact
statutes
or
acts
however
parliament
lacked
the
power
to
force
its
will
upon
the
monarch
its
only
leverage
was
the
threat
of
withholding
the
financial
means
required
to
implement
his
plans
18
parliamentary
concerns
and
the
petition
of
right
edit
many
concerns
were
raised
over
charles
s
marriage
in
1625
to
a
roman
catholic
french
princess
henrietta
maria
parliament
refused
to
assign
him
the
traditional
right
to
collect
customs
duties
for
his
entire
reign
deciding
instead
to
grant
it
only
on
a
provisional
basis
and
negotiate
with
him
19
charles
meanwhile
decided
to
send
an
expeditionary
force
to
relieve
the
french
huguenots
whom
french
royal
troops
held
besieged
in
la
rochelle
such
military
support
for
protestants
on
the
continent
potentially
alleviated
concerns
about
the
king
s
marriage
to
a
catholic
however
charles
s
insistence
on
giving
command
of
the
english
force
to
his
unpopular
royal
favourite
george
villiers
the
duke
of
buckingham
undermined
that
support
unfortunately
for
charles
and
buckingham
the
relief
expedition
proved
a
fiasco
1627
20
and
parliament
already
hostile
to
buckingham
for
his
monopoly
on
royal
patronage
opened
impeachment
proceedings
against
him
21
charles
responded
by
dissolving
parliament
this
saved
buckingham
but
confirmed
the
impression
that
charles
wanted
to
avoid
parliamentary
scrutiny
of
his
ministers
21
having
dissolved
parliament
and
unable
to
raise
money
without
it
the
king
assembled
a
new
one
in
1628
the
elected
members
included
oliver
cromwell
john
hampden
22
and
edward
coke
the
new
parliament
drew
up
a
petition
of
right
which
charles
accepted
as
a
concession
to
obtain
his
subsidy
23
the
petition
made
reference
to
magna
carta
24
but
did
not
grant
him
the
right
of
tonnage
and
poundage
which
charles
had
been
collecting
without
parliamentary
authorisation
since
1625
25
several
more
active
members
of
the
opposition
were
imprisoned
which
caused
outrage
25
one
john
eliot
subsequently
died
in
prison
and
came
to
be
seen
as
a
martyr
for
the
rights
of
parliament
26
personal
rule
edit
charles
avoided
calling
a
parliament
for
the
next
decade
a
period
known
as
the
personal
rule
of
charles
i
or
by
its
critics
as
the
eleven
years
tyranny
27
during
this
period
charles
s
policies
were
determined
by
his
lack
of
money
first
and
foremost
to
avoid
parliament
the
king
needed
to
avoid
war
charles
made
peace
with
france
and
spain
effectively
ending
england
s
involvement
in
the
thirty
years
war
however
that
in
itself
was
far
from
enough
to
balance
the
crown
s
finances
unable
to
raise
revenue
without
parliament
and
unwilling
to
convene
it
charles
resorted
to
other
means
one
was
to
revive
conventions
often
outdated
for
example
a
failure
to
attend
and
receive
knighthood
at
charles
s
coronation
became
a
finable
offence
with
the
fine
paid
to
the
crown
the
king
also
tried
to
raise
revenue
through
ship
money
demanding
in
1634
1636
that
the
inland
english
counties
pay
a
tax
for
the
royal
navy
to
counter
the
threat
of
privateers
and
pirates
in
the
english
channel
22
established
law
supported
the
policy
of
coastal
counties
and
inland
ports
such
as
london
paying
ship
money
in
times
of
need
but
it
had
not
been
applied
to
inland
counties
before
22
authorities
had
ignored
it
for
centuries
and
many
saw
it
as
yet
another
extra
parliamentary
illegal
tax
28
which
prompted
some
prominent
men
to
refuse
to
pay
it
charles
issued
a
writ
against
john
hampden
for
his
failure
to
pay
and
although
five
judges
including
sir
george
croke
supported
hampden
seven
judges
found
in
favour
of
the
king
in
1638
22
the
fines
imposed
on
people
who
refused
to
pay
ship
money
and
standing
out
against
its
illegality
aroused
widespread
indignation
28
during
his
personal
rule
charles
aroused
most
antagonism
through
his
religious
measures
he
believed
in
high
anglicanism
a
sacramental
version
of
the
church
of
england
theologically
based
upon
arminianism
a
creed
shared
with
his
main
political
adviser
archbishop
william
laud
29
in
1633
charles
appointed
laud
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
started
making
the
church
more
ceremonial
replacing
the
wooden
communion
tables
with
stone
altars
30
puritans
accused
laud
of
reintroducing
catholicism
and
when
they
complained
he
had
them
arrested
in
1637
john
bastwick
henry
burton
and
william
prynne
had
their
ears
cut
off
for
writing
pamphlets
attacking
laud
s
views
a
rare
penalty
for
gentlemen
and
one
that
aroused
anger
31
moreover
the
church
authorities
revived
statutes
from
the
time
of
elizabeth
i
about
church
attendance
and
fined
puritans
for
not
attending
anglican
services
32
rebellion
in
scotland
edit
the
end
of
charles
s
independent
governance
came
when
he
attempted
to
apply
the
same
religious
policies
in
scotland
the
church
of
scotland
reluctantly
episcopal
in
structure
had
independent
traditions
33
charles
wanted
one
uniform
church
throughout
britain
34
and
introduced
a
new
high
anglican
version
of
the
english
book
of
common
prayer
to
scotland
in
the
middle
of
1637
this
was
violently
resisted
a
riot
broke
out
in
edinburgh
35
which
may
have
been
started
in
st
giles
cathedral
according
to
legend
by
jenny
geddes
in
february
1638
the
scots
formulated
their
objections
to
royal
policy
in
the
national
covenant
36
this
document
took
the
form
of
a
loyal
protest
rejecting
all
innovations
not
first
tested
by
free
parliaments
and
general
assemblies
of
the
church
in
the
spring
of
1639
king
charles
i
accompanied
his
forces
to
the
scottish
border
to
end
the
rebellion
known
as
the
bishops
war
37
but
after
an
inconclusive
campaign
he
accepted
the
offered
scottish
truce
the
pacification
of
berwick
this
truce
proved
temporary
and
a
second
war
followed
in
mid
1640
a
scots
army
defeated
charles
s
forces
in
the
north
then
captured
newcastle
38
charles
eventually
agreed
not
to
interfere
in
scotland
s
religion
recall
of
the
english
parliament
edit
charles
needed
to
suppress
the
rebellion
in
scotland
but
had
insufficient
funds
to
do
so
he
needed
to
seek
money
from
a
newly
elected
english
parliament
in
1640
39
its
majority
faction
led
by
john
pym
used
this
appeal
for
money
as
a
chance
to
discuss
grievances
against
the
crown
and
oppose
the
idea
of
an
english
invasion
of
scotland
charles
took
exception
to
this
l√®se
majest√©
offense
against
the
ruler
and
after
negotiations
went
nowhere
dissolved
the
parliament
after
only
a
few
weeks
hence
its
name
the
short
parliament
39
without
parliament
s
support
charles
attacked
scotland
again
breaking
the
truce
at
berwick
and
suffered
comprehensive
defeat
the
scots
went
on
to
invade
england
occupying
northumberland
and
durham
39
meanwhile
another
of
charles
s
chief
advisers
thomas
wentworth
1st
viscount
wentworth
had
risen
to
the
role
of
lord
deputy
of
ireland
in
1632
40
and
brought
in
much
needed
revenue
for
charles
by
persuading
the
irish
catholic
gentry
to
pay
new
taxes
in
return
for
promised
religious
concessions
41
in
1639
charles
had
recalled
wentworth
to
england
and
in
1640
made
him
earl
of
strafford
attempting
to
have
him
achieve
similar
results
in
scotland
40
this
time
he
proved
less
successful
and
the
english
forces
fled
the
field
at
their
second
encounter
with
the
scots
in
1640
40
almost
the
whole
of
northern
england
was
occupied
and
charles
forced
to
pay
850
per
day
to
keep
the
scots
from
advancing
had
he
not
done
so
they
would
have
pillaged
and
burnt
the
cities
and
towns
of
northern
england
42
all
this
put
charles
in
a
desperate
financial
state
as
king
of
scots
he
had
to
find
money
to
pay
the
scottish
army
in
england
as
king
of
england
he
had
to
find
money
to
pay
and
equip
an
english
army
to
defend
england
his
means
of
raising
english
revenue
without
an
english
parliament
fell
critically
short
of
achieving
this
23
against
this
backdrop
and
according
to
advice
from
the
magnum
concilium
the
house
of
lords
but
without
the
commons
so
not
a
parliament
charles
finally
bowed
to
pressure
and
summoned
another
english
parliament
in
november
1640
37
the
long
parliament
edit
the
new
parliament
proved
even
more
hostile
to
charles
than
its
predecessor
it
immediately
began
to
discuss
grievances
against
him
and
his
government
with
pym
and
hampden
of
ship
money
fame
in
the
lead
they
took
the
opportunity
presented
by
the
king
s
troubles
to
force
various
reforming
measures
including
many
with
strong
anti
papist
themes
upon
him
43
the
members
passed
a
law
stating
that
a
new
parliament
would
convene
at
least
once
every
three
years
without
the
king
s
summons
if
need
be
other
laws
passed
making
it
illegal
for
the
king
to
impose
taxes
without
parliamentary
consent
and
later
gave
parliament
control
over
the
king
s
ministers
43
finally
the
parliament
passed
a
law
forbidding
the
king
to
dissolve
it
without
its
consent
even
if
the
three
years
were
up
these
laws
equated
to
a
tremendous
increase
in
parliamentary
power
ever
since
this
parliament
has
been
known
as
the
long
parliament
however
parliament
did
attempt
to
avert
conflict
by
requiring
all
adults
to
sign
the
protestation
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
charles
d
early
in
the
long
parliament
the
house
overwhelmingly
accused
thomas
wentworth
earl
of
strafford
of
high
treason
and
other
crimes
and
misdemeanors
henry
vane
the
younger
supplied
evidence
of
strafford
s
claimed
improper
use
of
the
army
in
ireland
alleging
that
he
had
encouraged
the
king
to
use
his
ireland
raised
forces
to
threaten
england
into
compliance
this
evidence
was
obtained
from
vane
s
father
henry
vane
the
elder
a
member
of
the
king
s
privy
council
who
refused
to
confirm
it
in
parliament
out
of
loyalty
to
charles
on
10
april
1641
pym
s
case
collapsed
but
pym
made
a
direct
appeal
to
the
younger
vane
to
produce
a
copy
of
the
notes
from
the
king
s
privy
council
discovered
by
the
younger
vane
and
secretly
turned
over
to
pym
to
the
great
anguish
of
the
elder
vane
44
these
notes
contained
evidence
that
strafford
had
told
the
king
sir
you
have
done
your
duty
and
your
subjects
have
failed
in
theirs
and
therefore
you
are
absolved
from
the
rules
of
government
and
may
supply
yourself
by
extraordinary
ways
you
have
an
army
in
ireland
with
which
you
may
reduce
the
kingdom
45
46
47
pym
immediately
launched
a
bill
of
attainder
stating
strafford
s
guilt
and
demanding
that
he
be
put
to
death
47
unlike
a
guilty
verdict
in
a
court
case
attainder
did
not
require
a
legal
burden
of
proof
to
be
met
but
it
did
require
the
king
s
approval
charles
however
guaranteed
strafford
that
he
would
not
sign
the
attainder
without
which
the
bill
could
not
be
passed
48
furthermore
the
lords
opposed
the
severity
of
a
death
sentence
on
strafford
yet
increased
tensions
and
a
plot
in
the
army
to
support
strafford
began
to
sway
the
issue
48
on
21
april
the
commons
passed
the
bill
204
in
favour
59
opposed
and
250
abstained
49
and
the
lords
acquiesced
charles
still
incensed
over
the
commons
handling
of
buckingham
refused
his
assent
strafford
himself
hoping
to
head
off
the
war
he
saw
looming
wrote
to
the
king
and
asked
him
to
reconsider
50
charles
fearing
for
the
safety
of
his
family
signed
on
10
may
49
strafford
was
beheaded
two
days
later
51
in
the
meantime
both
parliament
and
the
king
agreed
to
an
independent
investigation
into
the
king
s
involvement
in
strafford
s
plot
the
long
parliament
then
passed
the
triennial
act
1640
also
known
as
the
dissolution
act
in
may
1641
to
which
royal
assent
was
readily
granted
52
53
the
triennial
act
required
parliament
to
be
summoned
at
least
once
in
three
years
when
the
king
failed
to
issue
a
proper
summons
the
members
could
assemble
on
their
own
this
act
also
forbade
ship
money
without
parliament
s
consent
fines
in
distraint
of
knighthood
and
forced
loans
monopolies
were
cut
back
sharply
the
courts
of
the
star
chamber
and
high
commission
abolished
by
the
habeas
corpus
act
1640
and
the
triennial
act
respectively
54
all
remaining
forms
of
taxation
were
legalised
and
regulated
by
the
tonnage
and
poundage
act
1640
55
on
3
may
parliament
decreed
the
protestation
attacking
the
wicked
counsels
of
charles
s
government
whereby
those
who
signed
the
petition
undertook
to
defend
the
true
reformed
religion
parliament
and
the
king
s
person
honour
and
estate
throughout
may
the
house
of
commons
launched
several
bills
attacking
bishops
and
episcopalianism
in
general
each
time
defeated
in
the
lords
56
50
charles
and
his
parliament
hoped
that
the
execution
of
strafford
and
the
protestation
would
end
the
drift
towards
war
but
in
fact
they
encouraged
it
charles
and
his
supporters
continued
to
resent
parliament
s
demands
and
parliamentarians
continued
to
suspect
charles
of
wanting
to
impose
episcopalianism
and
unfettered
royal
rule
by
military
force
within
months
the
irish
catholics
fearing
a
resurgence
of
protestant
power
struck
first
and
all
ireland
soon
descended
into
chaos
57
rumours
circulated
that
the
king
supported
the
irish
and
puritan
members
of
the
commons
soon
started
murmuring
that
this
exemplified
the
fate
that
charles
had
in
store
for
them
all
58
on
4
january
1642
charles
followed
by
400
soldiers
entered
the
house
of
commons
and
attempted
to
arrest
five
members
on
a
charge
of
treason
59
the
members
had
learned
that
he
was
coming
and
escaped
charles
not
only
failed
to
arrest
them
but
turned
more
people
against
him
60
local
grievances
edit
in
the
summer
of
1642
these
national
troubles
helped
to
polarise
opinion
ending
indecision
about
which
side
to
support
or
what
action
to
take
opposition
to
charles
also
arose
from
many
local
grievances
for
example
imposed
drainage
schemes
in
the
fens
disrupted
the
livelihood
of
thousands
after
the
king
awarded
a
number
of
drainage
contracts
61
many
saw
the
king
as
indifferent
to
public
welfare
and
this
played
a
role
in
bringing
much
of
eastern
england
into
the
parliamentarian
camp
this
sentiment
brought
with
it
such
people
as
the
earl
of
manchester
and
oliver
cromwell
each
a
notable
wartime
adversary
of
the
king
conversely
one
of
the
leading
drainage
contractors
the
earl
of
lindsey
was
to
die
fighting
for
the
king
at
the
battle
of
edgehill
62
first
english
civil
war
1642
1646
edit
in
early
january
1642
a
few
days
after
failing
to
capture
five
members
of
the
house
of
commons
charles
feared
for
the
safety
of
his
family
and
retinue
and
left
the
london
area
for
the
north
country
63
further
frequent
negotiations
by
letter
between
the
king
and
the
long
parliament
through
to
early
summer
proved
fruitless
on
1
june
1642
64
the
english
lords
and
commons
approved
a
list
of
proposals
known
as
the
nineteen
propositions
in
these
demands
the
parliament
sought
a
larger
share
of
power
in
the
governance
of
the
kingdom
before
the
end
of
the
month
the
king
rejected
the
propositions
as
the
summer
progressed
cities
and
towns
declared
their
sympathies
for
one
faction
or
the
other
for
example
the
garrison
of
portsmouth
commanded
by
sir
george
goring
declared
for
the
king
65
but
when
charles
tried
to
acquire
arms
from
kingston
upon
hull
the
weaponry
depository
used
in
the
previous
scottish
campaigns
sir
john
hotham
the
military
governor
appointed
by
parliament
in
january
refused
to
let
charles
enter
the
town
66
and
when
charles
returned
with
more
men
later
hotham
drove
them
off
67
charles
issued
a
warrant
for
hotham
s
arrest
as
a
traitor
but
was
powerless
to
enforce
it
throughout
the
summer
tensions
rose
and
there
was
brawling
in
several
places
the
first
death
from
the
conflict
taking
place
in
manchester
67
68
at
the
outset
of
the
conflict
much
of
the
country
remained
neutral
though
the
royal
navy
and
most
english
cities
favoured
parliament
while
the
king
found
marked
support
in
rural
communities
the
war
quickly
spread
and
eventually
involved
every
level
of
society
many
areas
attempted
to
remain
neutral
some
formed
bands
of
clubmen
to
protect
their
localities
from
the
worst
excesses
of
the
armies
of
both
sides
69
but
most
found
it
impossible
to
withstand
both
king
and
parliament
on
one
side
the
king
and
his
supporters
fought
for
traditional
government
in
church
and
state
on
the
other
most
parliamentarians
initially
took
up
arms
to
defend
what
they
saw
as
a
traditional
balance
of
government
in
church
and
state
which
the
bad
advice
the
king
received
from
his
advisers
had
undermined
before
and
during
the
eleven
years
tyranny
the
views
of
the
members
of
parliament
ranged
from
unquestioning
support
of
the
king
at
one
point
during
the
first
civil
war
more
members
of
the
commons
and
lords
gathered
in
the
king
s
oxford
parliament
than
at
westminster
through
to
radicals
who
sought
major
reforms
in
religious
independence
and
redistribution
of
power
at
a
national
level
after
the
debacle
at
hull
charles
moved
on
to
nottingham
raising
the
royal
standard
there
on
22
august
1642
70
at
the
time
charles
had
with
him
about
2
000
cavalry
and
a
small
number
of
yorkshire
infantrymen
and
using
the
archaic
system
of
a
commission
of
array
71
his
supporters
started
to
build
a
larger
army
around
the
standard
charles
moved
in
a
westerly
direction
first
to
stafford
then
on
to
shrewsbury
as
support
for
his
cause
seemed
particularly
strong
in
the
severn
valley
area
and
in
north
wales
72
while
passing
through
wellington
he
declared
in
what
became
known
as
the
wellington
declaration
that
he
would
uphold
the
protestant
religion
the
laws
of
england
and
the
liberty
of
parliament
73
the
parliamentarians
who
opposed
the
king
did
not
remain
passive
in
this
pre
war
period
as
in
hull
they
took
measures
to
secure
strategic
towns
and
cities
by
appointing
to
office
men
sympathetic
to
their
cause
on
9
june
they
voted
to
raise
an
army
of
10
000
volunteers
and
appointed
robert
devereux
3rd
earl
of
essex
its
commander
three
days
later
74
he
received
orders
to
rescue
his
majesty
s
person
and
the
persons
of
the
prince
of
wales
and
the
duke
of
york
james
ii
out
of
the
hands
of
those
desperate
persons
who
were
about
them
75
the
lords
lieutenant
whom
parliament
appointed
used
the
militia
ordinance
to
order
the
militia
to
join
essex
s
army
76
two
weeks
after
the
king
had
raised
his
standard
at
nottingham
essex
led
his
army
north
towards
northampton
77
picking
up
support
along
the
way
including
a
detachment
of
huntingdonshire
cavalry
raised
and
commanded
by
oliver
cromwell
e
by
mid
september
essex
s
forces
had
grown
to
21
000
infantry
and
4
200
cavalry
and
dragoons
on
14
september
he
moved
his
army
to
coventry
and
then
to
the
north
of
the
cotswolds
79
a
strategy
that
placed
it
between
the
royalists
and
london
with
the
size
of
both
armies
now
in
the
tens
of
thousands
and
only
worcestershire
between
them
it
was
inevitable
that
cavalry
reconnaissance
units
would
meet
sooner
or
later
this
happened
in
the
first
major
skirmish
of
the
civil
war
when
a
troop
of
about
1
000
royalist
cavalry
under
prince
rupert
a
german
nephew
of
the
king
and
one
of
the
outstanding
cavalry
commanders
of
the
war
80
defeated
a
parliamentary
cavalry
detachment
under
colonel
john
brown
at
the
battle
of
powick
bridge
which
crossed
the
river
teme
close
to
worcester
81
rupert
withdrew
to
shrewsbury
where
a
council
of
war
discussed
two
courses
of
action
whether
to
advance
towards
essex
s
new
position
near
worcester
or
march
down
the
now
open
road
towards
london
the
council
decided
on
the
london
route
but
not
to
avoid
a
battle
for
the
royalist
generals
wanted
to
fight
essex
before
he
grew
too
strong
and
the
temper
of
both
sides
made
it
impossible
to
postpone
the
decision
in
the
earl
of
clarendon
s
words
it
was
considered
more
counsellable
to
march
towards
london
it
being
morally
sure
that
the
earl
of
essex
would
put
himself
in
their
way
82
hence
the
army
left
shrewsbury
on
12
october
gaining
two
days
start
on
the
enemy
and
moved
south
east
this
had
the
desired
effect
of
forcing
essex
to
move
to
intercept
them
82
the
first
pitched
battle
of
the
war
at
edgehill
on
23
october
1642
proved
inconclusive
both
royalists
and
parliamentarians
claiming
victory
83
the
second
field
action
the
stand
off
at
turnham
green
saw
charles
forced
to
withdraw
to
oxford
84
which
would
serve
as
his
base
for
the
rest
of
the
war
85
in
1643
royalist
forces
won
at
adwalton
moor
gaining
control
of
most
of
yorkshire
86
in
the
midlands
a
parliamentary
force
under
sir
john
gell
besieged
and
captured
the
cathedral
city
of
lichfield
after
the
death
of
the
original
commander
lord
brooke
87
this
group
then
joined
forces
with
sir
william
brereton
at
the
inconclusive
battle
of
hopton

subsequent
battles
in
the
west
of

down
also
went
to
the
royalists
88
prince
rupert
could
then
take
bristol
in
the
same
year
however
cromwell
formed
his
troop
of
ironsides
a
disciplined
unit
that
demonstrated
his
military
leadership
ability
with
their
assistance
he
won
a
victory
at
the
battle
of
gainsborough
in
july
89
at
this
stage
from
7
to
9
august
1643
there
were
some
popular
demonstrations
in
london
both
for
and
against
war
they
were
protesting
at
westminster
a
peace
demonstration
by
london
women
which
turned
violent
was
suppressed
the
women
were
beaten
and
fired
upon
with
live
ammunition
leaving
several
dead
many
were
arrested
and
incarcerated
in
bridewell
and
other
prisons
90
after
these
august
events
the
venetian
ambassador
in
england
reported
to
the
doge
that
the
london
government
took
considerable
measures
to
stifle
dissent
91
in
general
the
early
part
of
the
war
went
well
for
the
royalists
the
turning
point
came
in

the

royalists
independents
of

political
royalism

at

despite
being

charles

was
considered
by

almost
to
the
last
as
necessary

wales
edit
for
several
reasons
most
of
wales
was
not
as
engaged
in
the
english
civil
wars
to
the
same
degree
as
other
parts
of
the
british
isles
wales
was
isolated
from
england
both
physically
and
linguistically
so
the
welsh
were
not
as
much
engaged
as
england
in
the
issues
between
the
king
and
parliament
142
the
english
considered
wales
a
remote
land
with
welsh
not
english
as
the
primary
language
since
england
had
formally
assimilated
wales
into
the
kingdom
starting
in
1536
formal
agreements
had
been
put
in
place
under
henry
viii
and
continued
under
charles
i
that
allowed
for
welsh
local
administrative
authority
and
economic
control
which
allowed
the
welsh
to
function
to
some
degree
independently
143
144
145
another
factor
was
the
puritan
religion
which
played
a
major
role
in
the
english
civil
wars
but
was
not
widely
practised
throughout
wales
welsh
puritan
religious
dominance
was
found
in
northeast
wales

the

became
a
matter
of
heated
political
controversy
john
calvin
of
geneva
had
formulated
a
doctrine
of
presbyterianism
which
held
that
the
offices
of
presbyter
and
episkopos
in
the
new
testament
were
identical
he
rejected
the
doctrine
of
apostolic
succession
calvin
s
follower
john
knox
brought
presbyterianism
to
scotland
when
the
scottish
church
was
reformed
in
1560
in
practice
presbyterianism
meant
that
committees
of
lay
elders
had
a
substantial
voice
in
church
government
as
opposed
to
merely
being
subjects
to
a
ruling

this
vision
of
at

partial
democracy
in

paralleled
the
struggles
between

the

a
body
within
the
puritan
movement
in
the
church
of

sought
to
abolish

office

remake

i
reacting
against
the
perceived
contumacy
of
his
presbyterian
scottish
subjects
adopted
no
bishop
no
king
as
a
slogan
he
tied
the
hierarchical
authority
of
the
bishop

the
absolute
authority

sought

attacks
on

authority

laud
aggressively
attacked
the
presbyterian

the
controversy
eventually
led
to
laud
s
impeachment
for
treason
by
a
bill

subsequent
execution
charles
also
attempted
to
impose
episcopacy

some
attempt
has
been
made
to
provide
rough
estimates
165
in

a
conservative
estimate
is
that
roughly
100
000
people
died
from
war
related
disease
during
the
three
civil
wars

records
count
84

counting
in

and
the

estimate
of
190
000
dead
is
achieved
166
out
of
a
total
population
of
about
five
million
167

is
estimated

from

15
20
of

served

as
was

in

rather
than
large
pitched
battles
there
were
a
total
of
645
engagements
throughout
the
wars
588
of
these
involved
fewer
than
250
casualties
in
total
with
these
588
accounting
for
39
838
fatalities
average
count
of
less
than
68
or
nearly
half
of
the
conflict
s
combat
deaths
there
were
only
9
major
pitched
battles
at
least
1
000
fatalities
which
in

accounted
for
15
of
casualties
169
an
anecdotal
example
of
how
high
casualties
in
england
may
have
been
perceived
is
to
be
found
in
the
posthumously
published
writing
generally
titled
the
history
of

a

man
richard

172
there

how

related
diseases
but
if
the

ratio

is
applied
to

a

167
figures

miracles
of

certainly
the

inflicted
on

was
massive

estimate
provided
by

william

estimated
that
112
000
protestants
and
504
000
catholics
were
killed
through
plague
war
and

giving
an
estimated
total
of
616
000
dead
174
out
of
a
pre
war
population
of
about
one
and
a
half
million
167
although
petty
s
figures
are
the
best
available
they
are
still
acknowledged
as
tentative
they
do

40

driven

of
whom
served
as
soldiers
in

continental
armies

were
sold

the

many
of

sold
to
landowners
in
new
england
eventually
prospered
but
many
sold
to
landowners
in
the
west
indies
were
worked
to
death
these
estimates
indicate
that
england
suffered
a
4
per

scotland
a
loss
of
6
per

while
ireland
suffered
a
loss

41

to
understand
the
devastation
of
ireland
in

the
great
famine
of

1852
resulted
in

was
that
the

in

whig

views
edit
in
the
early
decades
of
the
20th
century
the
whig
school
was
the
dominant
theoretical
view
it
explained
the
civil
war
as
resulting
from
centuries
of
struggle
between
parliament
notably
the
house
of
commons
and
the
monarchy
with
parliament
defending
the
traditional
rights
of
englishmen
while
the
stuart
monarchy
continually
attempted
to
expand
its
right
to
dictate
law
arbitrarily
the
major
whig
historian
s
r
gardiner
popularised
the
idea
that
the
english
civil
war
was
a
puritan
revolution
193
that
challenged
the
repressive
stuart
church
and
prepared
the
way
for
religious
toleration
thus
puritanism
was
seen
as
the
natural
ally
of
a
people
preserving
their
traditional
rights
against
arbitrary
monarchical
power
the
whig
view
was
challenged
and
largely
superseded
by
the
marxist
school
which
became
popular
in
the
1940s
and
saw
the
english
civil
war
as
a
bourgeois
revolution
according
to
marxist
historian
christopher
hill
the
civil
war
was
a
class
war
in
which
the
despotism
of
charles
i
was
defended
by
the
reactionary
forces
of
the
established
church
and
conservative
landlords
parliament
beat
the
king
because
it
could
appeal
to
the
enthusiastic
support
of
the
trading
and
industrial
classes
in
town
and
countryside
to
the
yeomen
and
progressive
gentry
and
to
wider
masses
of
the
population
whenever
they
were

the

king
charles

remains

not
just
as
king
of

but
through
his
relationship
with
the
peoples
of
his
other
realms
for
example
the
wars
began
when
charles
forced
an
anglican
prayer
book
upon
scotland
and
when
this
was
met
with
resistance
from
the
covenanters
he
needed
an
army
to
impose
his
will
however
this
need
of
military
funds
forced
charles
i
to
call
an
english
parliament
which
was
not
willing
to
grant
the
needed
revenue
unless
he
addressed
their
grievances

charles
was
left
in
a
state
of
near
permanent
crisis

by
the
demands
of
the
various
factions
for

charles
finally
made
terms
with
the
covenanters
in
august

although
this
might

the
position
of
the
english
parliament
the
irish
rebellion
of
1641
broke
out
in
october

largely
negating
the
political
advantage
he
had
obtained
by
relieving
himself
of
the
cost
of
the
scottish
invasion
199
a
number
of
revisionist
historians
such
as
william
m
lamont
regarded
the
conflict
as
a
religious
war
with
john
morrill

stating
the
english
civil

was
not
the
first
european
revolution
it
was
the
last
of

have
been
motivated
by

religious
beliefs
to

their
opposition

violated
crucial
constitutional

201
however
in
some
cases
it
may
be
argued
that
they
hid
their
pro
anglican
and
anti
catholic
motives
behind
