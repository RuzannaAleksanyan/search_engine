ichthyotitan
ˌɪkθiəˈtaɪtən
is
an
extinct
genus
of
giant
ichthyosaur
from
the
late
triassic
rhaetian
known
from
the
westbury
mudstone
formation
in
somerset
england
it
is
believed
to
be
a
shastasaurid
extending
the
family
s
range
by
13
million
years
up
to
the
latest
triassic
the
discovery
of
ichthyotitan
has
been
considered
evidence
that
shastasaurids
were
still
thriving
until
their
disappearance
in
the
triassic
jurassic
extinction
event
the
genus
contains
a
single
species
i
severnensis
it
is
known
from
two
fragmentary
surangular
bones
of
the
lower
jaw
discovered
in
separate
places
in
2016
and
2020
other
specimens
throughout
western
europe
have
been
linked
to
the
species
based
on
similar
osteological
features
although
their
affiliation
is
uncertain

identified
the

also
prompted
the

to
reinterpret

the

more
complete

with
some
fragments
possibly
belonging

histological
features
suggest
that
the
specimen
was
still
growing
so
was
either
a
subadult

multiple
encrusting
organisms

bivalves
are
present

lomax

a
new
genus

species
of
probable
shastasaurid
ichthyosaur
based
on
brsmg
cg3178
and
brsmg

the
generic
name
ichthyotitan
combines
a
reference
to
ichthyosaurus
whose
name
means
fish
lizard
combining
the
greek
words
ἰχθύς
ichthys
meaning
fish
and
σαῦρος
sauros
meaning
lizard
with
the
greek
suffix
τιτάν
titan
meaning
giant
the
specific
name
severnensis
references
the
severn
estuary
near

the

description

ichthyotitan
is
the
only
shastasaurid
and
giant
ichthyosaur
to
be
known
from
the
rhaetian
found
in
the
fossil
record
13
million
years
after
their
relatives
5
the
lineage
is
believed
to
have
gone
extinct
immediately
after
in
the
triassic
jurassic
extinction
event
with
later
ichthyosaurs
never
reaching
similar
sizes
until
their
extinction
in
the
early
late
cretaceous

size
estimates
edit
while
its
incompleteness
made
the
size
of
the
animal
difficult
to
determine
it
was
clearly
very
large
by
comparing
the
lilstock
surangular
to
the
same
bone
in
shastasaurus
sikanniensis
as
a
model
the
researchers
estimated
the
lilstock
ichthyosaur
to
have
been
around
26
metres
85
ft
long
or
25
larger
by
direct
scaling
nearly
the
size
of
a
blue
whale
scaling
based
on
the
height
at
the
coronoid
process
compared
to
besanosaurus
found
a
shorter
length
estimate
of
22
metres
72
ft
researchers
pointed
out
that
while
differences
in
proportions
between
species
make
these
estimates
speculative
they
were
conventional
given
the
scarcity
of
material
1
8
the
2024
study
describing
ichthyotitan
pointed
out
inaccuracies
in
the
besanosaurus
scaling
due
to
a
misidentification
of
the
coronoid
process
with
the
nearby
mame
muscle
adductor
mandibulae
externus
process
comparing
the
position
of
the
mame
process
in
the
bas
specimen
to
that
in
besanosaurus
they
provided
a
revised
length
estimate
of
25
metres
82
ft
likely
making
it
the
largest
marine
reptile
ever
described
3
the
aust
specimens
tentatively
linked
to
ichthyotitan
have
been
informally
estimated
to
be
even
larger
at
30
to
35
metres
98
to
115
ft
long

bone
anatomy
edit
apart
from
its
size
features
of
the
surangular
bone
distinguish
ichthyotitan
from
other
shastasaurids
the
surangular
is
spatulate
at
its
posterior
end
and
shows
an
almost
90
degree
upwards
turn
this
is
consistent
in
both
the
lilstock
and
bas
specimens
ruling
out
taphonomic
distortion
in
comparison
other
shastasaurids
show
a
much
less
marked
curvature
an
extensive
mame
process
is
present
for
muscle
attachment
another
thin
process
posterior
to
the
latter
shows
vertical
ridges
and
furrows
on
its
medial
side
and
has
also
been
reported
in
the
cuers
specimen
3
the
coronoid
process
is
also
less
prominent
laterally
than
in
shonisaurus
while
the
shaft
shows
a
subcircular
rather
than
oblong
cross
section
at
that
position
while
less
well
preserved
the
anterior
part
of
the
surangular
bears
a
lateral
groove
believed
to
represent
the
continuation
of
the
fossa
surangularis
also
known
from
the
cuers
specimen
3
another
bone
fragment
is
believed
to
correspond
to
the
angular
bone
by
comparison
with
cymbospondylus
youngorum
running
ventrally
across
the
entire
length
of
the
surangular
in
the
bas
specimen
while
a
suture
is
present
between
the
two
bones
it
disappears
in
a
section
anterior
to
the
coronoid
process
along
with
the
continuous
bone
structure
this
implies
that
the
bones
were
possibly
fused
in
life
a
unique
condition
among
ichthyosaurs
researchers
speculate
that
this
was
related
to
ichthyotitan
s
large
size
and
the
individual
s
maturity
this
morphology
was
also
observed
in
one
of
the
aust
bones
and
is
believed
to
also
be
present
in
the
lilstock
specimen
despite
poorer
preservation
3
similarly
unique
patterns
of
periosteal
growth
in
ichthyotitan
are
believed
to
have
played
a
role
in
approaching
the
biological
size
limits
in
vertebrates
5
paleoecology
edit
older
studies
have
suggested
that
shastasaurids
were
suction
feeders
but
current
research
indicates
that
the
jaws
of
shastasaurid
ichthyosaurs
do
not
fit
the
suction
feeding
profile
this
is
because
their
short
and
narrow
hyoid
bones
are
unsuitable
to
withstand
impact
forces
for
such
kind
of
feeding
10
and
some
species
like
shonisaurus
had
robust
sectorial
teeth
with
gut
contents
of
mollusc
shells
and
vertebrates
11
12
ichthyotitan
is
believed
to
have
been
a
predator
hunting
smaller
prey
including
other
marine
reptiles
in
a
fashion
similar
to
an
orca
this
has
been
taken
as
evidence
for
the
richness
of
marine
food
webs
throughout
the
triassic
believed
to
be
built
upon
newly
evolved
forms
of
plankton
and
would
show
that
shastasaurids
were
flourishing
until
their
disappearance
in
the
end
triassic
extinction
13
their
ecology
made
their
remains
vulnerable
to
scavengers
with
one
of
the
fossils
showing
signs
of
scavenging
before
burial
explaining
the
scarcity
of
known
fossils
