an

consolidated

in
the
republic
of
florence
under
cosimo
de
medici
during
the
first
half
of
the

the

originated
in
the
mugello
region
of
tuscany
and
prospered
gradually
until
it
was
able
to
fund
the
medici
bank
this
bank
was
the
largest
in
europe
during
the
15th
century
and
facilitated
the
medicis
rise
to
political
power
in

officially
remained
citizens

the

elevated
to
the

duchy
from
its
inception

the

wealth

the
medici
bank
from
when
it
was
created
in
1397
to
its
fall
in
1494
was
one
of
the
most
prosperous

respected
institutions
in
europe
and
the
medici
family
was
considered
the
wealthiest
in
europe
for
a
time
from
this
base
they
acquired
political
power
initially
in
florence

later
in

for

the

in

was

but
in
1298
one
of
the
leading
banking
families
of
europe
the
bonsignoris
went
bankrupt
and
the
city
of
siena
lost
its
status
as
the
banking
centre
of
italy
to
florence
12
until
the
late
14th
century
the
leading
family
of
florence
was
the
house
of
albizzi
in
1293
the
ordinances
of
justice
were
enacted
effectively
they
became
the
constitution
of
the
republic
of
florence
throughout
the
italian
renaissance
13
the
city
s
numerous
luxurious
palazzi
were
becoming
surrounded
by
townhouses
built
by
the
prospering
merchant
class
14
the
main
challengers
to
the
albizzi
family
were
the
medici
first
under
giovanni
di
bicci
de
medici
later
under
his
son
cosimo
di
giovanni
de
medici
and
great
grandson
lorenzo
de

the
medici
controlled
the
medici
bank
then
europe
s
largest
bank
and
an
array
of
other
enterprises
in
florence
and
elsewhere
in
1433
the
albizzi
managed
to
have
cosimo
exiled
15
the
next
year
however
a
pro
medici
signoria
civic
government
led
by
tommaso
soderini
oddo
altoviti

lucca

was
elected
and
cosimo
returned
the
medici
became
the
city
s
leading
family
a
position
they
would
hold
for
the
next
three
centuries
florence
remained
a
republic
until
1537
traditionally
marking
the
end
of
the
high
renaissance
in
florence
but
the
instruments
of
republican
government
were
firmly
under
the
control
of
the
medici
and
their
allies
save
during
intervals
after
1494
and
1527
cosimo
and
lorenzo
rarely
held
official
posts
but
were
the
unquestioned
leaders
the
medici
family
was
connected
to
most
other
elite
families
of
the
time
through
marriages
of
convenience
partnerships
or
employment
so
the
family
had
a
central
position
in
the
social
network
several
families
had
systematic
access
to
the
rest
of
the
elite
families
only
through
the
medici
perhaps
similar
to
banking
relationships
some
examples
of
these
families
include
the
bardi
altoviti
ridolfi
cavalcanti
and
the
tornabuoni
this
has
been
suggested
as
a
reason
for
the
rise
of
the
medici
family
16
members
of
the
family
rose
to
some
prominence
in
the
early

in
the
wool
trade
especially
with
france
and
spain
despite
the
presence
of
some
medici
in

institutions
they
were
still

less
notable

became

of
the
richest
men
in
the
city

although

never

the
medici
additionally
benefited
from
the

vast
deposits

alum
in
tolfa
in
1461
alum
is
essential
as
a
mordant
in
the
dyeing
of
certain
cloths
and
was
used
extensively
in
florence
where
the
main
industry
was
textile
manufacturing
before
the
medici
the
turks
were
the
only
exporters
of
alum
so
europe
was
forced
to
buy
from
them
until
the
discovery
in
tolfa
pius
ii
granted
the
medici
family
a
monopoly
on
the
mining
there
making
them
the
primary
producers
of
alum
in
europe

three
successive
generations
of
the

cosimo
piero

ruled
over
florence

greater
part
of

they
clearly
dominated

representative
government
without
abolishing
it
altogether

these
three
members
of
the
medici
family
had
great
skills
in
the
management
of
so
restive
and
independent
a
city
as
florence
when
lorenzo
died
in
1492
however
his
son
piero
proved
quite
incapable
of
responding
successfully
to
challenges
caused
by
the
french
invasion
of
italy
in
1492
and
within
two
years
he
and

allowed

coats
of
arms
edit
the
origin
of
the
medici
coat
of
arms
is
not
recorded
one
unproven
story
traces
their
ancestry
to
a
knight
of
charlemagne
s
averardo
who
defeated
a
giant
mugello
in
reward
charlemagne
is
said
to
have
rewarded
averardo
with
the
shield
mauled
by
the
giant
with
the
dents
in
the
shape
of
balls
and
the
giant
s
lands
in
mugello
the
simplest
though
also
unproven
theory
suggests
that
the
balls
represented
coins
copied
from
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
guild
of
moneychangers
arte
del
cambio
to
which
the
medici
belonged
that
shield
was
red
strewn
with
byzantine
coins
bezants
72
73
the
number
of
balls
also
varied
with
time
as
shown
below
it
has
also
been
argued
that
these
coins
referenced
the
three
coins
or
golden
balls
associated
with
st
nicholas
particularly
as
the
saint
was
invoked
by
italian
bankers
as
they
took
oaths
74
as
an
italian
vocabulary
word
medici
means
medical
doctors
and
identifications
with
the
family
members
as
physicians
may
be
found
among
their
names
as
early
as
the
eleventh
century
fanciful
stories
depict
the
images
as
pills
or
cupping
glasses
a
late
medieval
medical
instrument
used
to
draw
blood
pills
did
not
exist
until
much
later
and
bloodletting
was
not
a
common
practice
at
the
time
of
the
first
medici
coat
of
arms
art
historian
rocky
ruggiero
suggests
plausibly
however
that
the
images
may
represent
whole
ripe
blood
oranges
that
typically
are
grown
in
italy
although
knowledge
of
vitamins
did
not
exist
at
the
time
the
benefit
of
oranges
for
certain
diseases
was
recognized
and
their
association
with
recommendations
by
medical
doctors
suggests
to
ruggiero
that
this
likely
is
the
imagery
intended
in
the
coats
of
arms
for
the
medici
family
75
alternatively
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
medici
coat
of
arms
was
initially
inspired
by
symbols
drawn
from
etruscan
votive
sculpture
examples
of
which
feature
an
oval
dome
with
balls
echoing
the
forms
of
the
medici
shield
as
well
as
six
balls
within
a
triangle
as
found
in
the
alternative
triangular
version
of
the
medici
emblem
76
this
particular
influence
offers
an
explanation
for
the
red
hue
of
the
medici
balls
the
colour
of
the
terracotta
sculpture
it
would
also
have
reflected
the
family
s
interest
in
etruscan
art
and
culture
77
in
addition
the
notion
of
etruscan
votive
sculpture
would
have
chimed
with
the
participation
of
the
medici
in
the
religious
custom
of
offering
up
votive
statues
a
practice
that
recalled
the
ancient
etruscan
convention
of
donating
sculptures
in
the
hope
of
or
gratitude
for
divine
favour
78
such
favours
would
have
included
the
wish
for
a
strong
and
healthy
family
both
for
the
supplicant
and
their
descendants
