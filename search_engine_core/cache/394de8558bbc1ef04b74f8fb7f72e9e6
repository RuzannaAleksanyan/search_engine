artistry
edit
robinson
s
early
influences
include
video
game
music
in
particular
dance
dance
revolution
he
is
a
major
fan
of
anime
and
japanese
culture
and
incorporates
these
elements
into
his
music
105
106
he
has
stated
that
he
originally
attempted
to
emulate
the
music
that
he
heard
in
japanese
games
which
stemmed
to
producing
and
then
to
performing
as
a
dj
107
during
his
language
tour
robinson
continually
began
to
grow
tired
of
the
current
dance
music
scene
centered
around
formulaic
songs
with
timed
builds
and
beat
drops
designed
to
excite
people
at
festivals
and
clubs
108
robinson
stated
the
more
i
forced
myself
to
work
within
those
dj
friendly
limits
the
more
i
resented
the
genre
109
he
then
spent
the
next
year
or
so
working
on
a
new
album
and
live
show
of
which
he
stated
when
i
do
change
the
style
of
my
show
into
the
live
thing
i
m
going
to
do
later
this
year
i
want
the
shift
in
focus
to
be
clear
108
robinson
did
not
release
or
produce
any
new
music
in
2015
due
to
his
depression
110
which
he
later
reflected
on
in
his
second
studio
album
nurture
he
explained
that
the
lyrics
in
nurture
were
about
his
struggle
to
create
and
be
proud
of
the
music
he
was
writing
due
to
having
depression
111
in
a
letter
to
his
fans
he
detailed
how
he
used
to
struggle
with
writing
music
and
how
he
overcame
that
struggle
i
realized
i
shouldn
t
write
music
with
the
expectation
that
the
productivity
or
achievement
will
fix
my
problems
but
instead
with
the
hope
that
my
honest
expression
will
move
people
the
way
music
moves
me
so
when
i
was
really
struggling
to
write
and
it
seemed
impossible
instead
of
thinking
you
re
struggling
because
you
re
a
fraud
you
re
clearly
not
cut
out
for
this
i
began
to
tell
myself
yeah
this
is
what
you
sacrifice
