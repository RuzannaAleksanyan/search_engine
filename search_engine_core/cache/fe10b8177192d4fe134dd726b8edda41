switch

ˈtoʊɡə
is
a
switch
on
the
autothrottle
of
modern
large
aircraft
with
two
modes
takeoff
to
and
go
around
ga
the
mode
is
dependent
on
the
phase
of
flight
usually
on
approach
to
land
the
autopilot
will
be
set
to
approach
mode
therefore
if
the
to
ga
switch
is
pressed
it
will
activate
the
go
around
mode
of
the
autothrottle
about
90
92
n1
if
pressed
again
go
around
thrust
will
increase
to
full
100
n1
conversely
when
takeoff
is
set
on
the
autopilot
the
switch
activates
takeoff
mode
of
the
autothrottle
on
boeing
aircraft
to
ga
modes
are
selected
by
a
separate
button
near
the
throttle
levers
but
on
airbus
aircraft
it
is
activated
by
advancing
the
thrust
levers
forward
to
the
to
ga
detent
usage
in
takeoff
edit
once
an
aircraft
has
lined
up
on
the
runway
the
pilots
first
increase
the
engine
power
to
40
60
n1
low
pressure
compressor
rpm
on
boeing
aircraft
and
50
n1
on
airbus
aircraft
large
jet
engines
accelerate
slowly
from
idle
to
approximately
40
and
stabilising
the
engines
prior
to
applying
takeoff
power
prevents
a
large
thrust
asymmetry
from
causing
directional
problems
if
one
engine
accelerates
more
quickly
this
can
also
reduce
the
risk
of
a
compressor
stall
once
the
engines
are
confirmed
to
be
stable
by
the
pilot
monitoring
the
pilots
then
either
press
the
to
ga
switch
causing
the
thrust
levers
to
automatically
advance
themselves
to
the
appropriate
power
setting
on
boeings

or
manually
advance
the
thrust
levers
to

in
airbus
aircraft
if
de
rated
takeoff
power
is
desired
the
thrust
levers
are
instead
advanced
to
the
flx
mct
detent
in
all
cases
the
engine
speeds
then
increase
to
provide
the
computed
takeoff
power
flight
management
computers
on
modern
aircraft
determine
the
amount
of
power
needed
by
the
engines
in
order
to
reach
takeoff
speed
a
number
of
factors
have
to
be
taken
into
account
including
runway
length
wind
speed
temperature
and
most
importantly
the
weight
of
the
aircraft
in
older
aircraft
these
calculations
were
performed
by
the
pilots
before
takeoff
the
advantage
of
having
such
a
system
is
the
ability
to
reduce
wear
and
tear
on
the
engines
by
using
only
as
much
power
as
is
actually
required
to
ensure
the
aircraft
reaches
a
safe
takeoff
speed
usage
in
go
around
edit
the
go
around
setting
is
used
during
the
approach
if
a
pilot
finds
that
they
are
unable
to
land
safely
or
deems
it
necessary
to
go
around
for
any
reason
activating
this
switch
usually
positioned
on
the
back
of
the
throttle
levers
will
increase
the
power
to
go
around
thrust
if
the
switch
is
pressed
again
the
engine
power
will
increase
to
full
thrust
importantly
the
to
ga
switch
modifies
the
autopilot
mode
so
it
does
not
continue
to
follow
the
instrument
landing
system
ils
glide
slope
and
it
overrides
any
auto
throttle
mode
which
would
keep
the
aircraft
in
landing
configuration
on
airbus
aircraft
it
does
not
disengage
the
autopilot
but
causes
it
to
stop
following
the
ils
and
to
perform
the
go
around
maneuver
automatically
in
an
emergency
situation
using
a
to
ga
switch
is
often
the
quickest
way
of
increasing
thrust
to
abort
a
landing
on
some
aircraft
the
to
ga
switch
commands
the
autopilot
to
fly
a
missed
approach
pattern
if
the
autopilot
is
programmed
to
do
so
