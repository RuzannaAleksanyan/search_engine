gay
rights
movement
in

he
gave
a
speech
at
the
society
for
individual
rights
in

was
more
outspoken
than

contemporary
mattachine
society
based
on
the
contemporary
campaign
for
african
american
voting
rights
he
suggested
that
gays
should
use
their
votes

i
think
that
we
must
not
be
afraid
of
controversy
or
tension
we
in
the
civil
rights
movement
have
learned
how
to
rock
the
boat
how
to
disturb
complacent
middle
class
people
how
to
root
out
complacency
it
is
good
to
have
strong
disagreement
because
from
it
comes
movement
and
reaction
controversy
is
the
need
it
stimulates
communication
and
the
exchange
of
ideas
rejection
once
in
awhile
is
a
good
thing
too
it
forces
one
to
find
oneself
tension
leads
to
resolution
to
movement
at
least
it
lets
people
know
that
a
living
fulfilling
movement
is
on
its
way
