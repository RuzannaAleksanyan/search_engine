preludethere
was
a
massive
russian
military
build
up
near

border
in

2021
44
and
again
in
both
russia

belarus
from
october
2021
onward
45
members
of
the
russian
government
repeatedly
denied
having
plans
to
invade
or
attack
ukraine
with
denials
being
issued
up
to
the
day
before
the
invasion
46
47
48
the
decision
to
invade
ukraine
was
reportedly
made
by
putin
and
a
small
group
of
war
hawks
or
siloviki
in
putin
s
inner
circle
including
national
security
adviser
nikolai
patrushev
and
defence
minister
sergei
shoigu
49
in
july
2021
putin
published
an
essay
on
the
historical
unity
of
russians
and
ukrainians
in
which
he
called
ukraine
historically
russian
lands
and
claimed
there
is
no
historical
basis
for
the
idea
of
ukrainian
people
as
a
nation
separate
from
the
russians
50
51
days
before
the
invasion
putin
claimed
that
ukraine
never
had
real
statehood
and
that
modern
ukraine
was
a
mistake
created
by
the
russian
bolsheviks
52
american
historian
timothy
snyder
described
putin
s
ideas
as
imperialism
53
british
journalist
edward
lucas
described
it
as
historical
revisionism
other
observers
found
that
russia
s
leadership
held
a
distorted
view
of
ukraine
as
well
as
of
its
own
history
54
and
that
these
distortions
were
propagated
through
the
state
55
during
the
second
build
up
russia
demanded
that
nato
end
all
activity
in
eastern
europe
and
ban
ukraine
or
any
former
soviet
state
from
ever
joining
nato
56
russia
threatened
an
unspecified
military
response
if
nato
followed
an
aggressive
line
57
these
demands
were
widely
seen
as
non
viable
eastern
european
states
have
willingly
joined
nato
for
security
reasons
and
their
governments
sought
protection
from
russian
irredentism
58
a
treaty
to
prevent
ukraine
joining
would
go
against
nato
s
open
door
policy
despite
nato
s
unenthusiastic
response
to
ukrainian
requests
to
join
59
nato
secretary
general
jens
stoltenberg
replied
that
russia
has
no
say
on
whether
ukraine
joins
and
that
russia
has
no
right
to
establish
a
sphere
of
influence
to
try
to
control
their
neighbours
60
nato
s
official
policy
is
that
it
does
not
seek
confrontation
and
nato
and
russia
had
co
operated
until
russia
annexed
crimea
61
nato
offered
to
improve
communication
with
russia
to
discuss
missile
placements
and
military
exercises
as
long
as
russia
withdrew
troops
from
ukraine
s
borders
62
but
russia
did
not
do
so
french
president
emmanuel
macron
and
german
chancellor
olaf
scholz
both
made
efforts
in
february
2022
to
prevent
war
63
macron
met
putin
but
failed
to
dissuade
him
from
the
invasion
scholz
warned
putin
heavy
sanctions
would
be
imposed
should
he
invade
and
told
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskyy
to
declare
ukraine
a
neutral
state
and
renounce
its
aspirations
to

zelenskyy
replied

such
a

they
all

that

open

that
freezes
the

along

this
has
been
received
with
skepticism
by
ukrainians
and
its
supporters
with
criticism
that
it
could
be
an
insincere
opportunistic
public
relations
ploy
by
russia
that
would
give
it
time
to
rebuild
its
weakened
army
before
renewing
