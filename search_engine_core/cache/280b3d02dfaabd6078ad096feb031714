free
content
encompasses
all
works
in

public

and
also
those
copyrighted
works
whose
licenses
honor
and
uphold
the
definition
of
free
cultural
work
in
most
countries
the
berne
convention
grants
copyright
holders
monopolistic
control
over
their
creations
by
default
therefore
copyrighted
content
must
be
explicitly
declared
free
this
is
usually
accomplished
by

including
licensing

free
content
is
legally
very
similar
to

an
analogy
is
a
use
of
the

which
describe
ideological

describes

as

for

legal
matterscopyrightcopyright
is
a
legal
concept
which
gives
the
author
or
creator
of
a
work
legal
control
over
the
duplication
and
public
performance
of
their
work
in
many
jurisdictions
this
is
limited
by
a
time
period
after
which
the
works
then
enter
the
public
domain
copyright
laws
are
a
balance
between
the
rights
of
creators
of
intellectual
and
artistic
works
and
the
rights
of
others
to
build
upon
those
works
during
the
time
period
of
copyright
the
author
s
work
may
only
be
copied
modified
or
publicly
performed
with
the
consent
of
the
author
unless
the
use
is
a
fair
use
traditional
copyright
control
limits
the
use
of
the
work
of
the
author
to
those
who
either
pay
royalties
to
the
author
for
usage
of
the
author
s
content
or
limit
their
use
to
fair
use
secondly
it
limits
the
use
of
content
whose
author
cannot
be
found
11
finally
it
creates
a
perceived
barrier
between
authors
by
limiting
derivative
works
such
as
mashups
and
collaborative

copyleftcopyleft
is
a
play
on
the
word
copyright
and
describes
the
practice
of
using
copyright
law
to
remove
restrictions
on
distributing
copies
and
modified
versions
of
a
work
14
the
aim
of
copyleft
is
to
use
the
legal
framework
of
copyright
to
enable
non
author
parties
to
be
able
to
reuse
and
in
many
licensing
schemes
modify
content
that
is
created
by
an
author
unlike
works
in
the
public
domain
the
author
still
maintains
copyright
over
the
material
however
the
author
has
granted
a
non
exclusive
license
to
any
person
to
distribute
and
often
modify
the
work
copyleft
licenses
require
that
any
derivative
works
be
distributed
under
the
same
terms
and
that
the
original
copyright
notices
be
maintained
a
symbol
commonly
associated
with
copyleft
is
a
reversal
of
the
copyright
symbol
facing
the
other
way
the
opening
of
the
c
points
left
rather
than
right
unlike
the
copyright
symbol
the
copyleft
symbol
does
not
have
a
codified
meaning

such
as

engineering
technology
has
reduced
the
cost
of

and
reduced

by
individuals
or
small

projects
to
provide

and
multimedia
content
have
become
increasingly
prominent
owing
to
the
ease
of
dissemination
of
materials
that
are
associated
with
the
development
of
computer
technology
such
dissemination
may
have
been
too
costly
prior

free

schemes
such
as
some
of
the
licenses
made
by

have
allowed
for
the

of

under
a
clear
set
of
legal
permissions
not
all
creative
commons
licenses
are
entirely

their

may
range
from
very
liberal

the

of

are
not

although
the
percentage
of
works
that
are
open

is
growing
open

refers
to

that
are
free
of
all
restrictions
to

and
free
of
many
restrictions
on

e

24
authors
may
see
open

publishing
as
a
way
of
expanding
the
audience
that
is
able
to
access

to
allow

for

publishing
of
free
works
such
publications
are
currently
more
common
in
science
than
humanities
various
funding
institutions
and
governing
research
bodies
have
mandated
that
academics
must
produce
their
works
to
be
open

in
order
to
qualify
for
funding
such
as
the

some

adopted
open

publishing

by
introducing
their

some

either
by
a
formal
institution

33
or
informally

or
departments
open
content
publication
has
been
seen
as
a
method
of
reducing
costs
associated
with
information
retrieval
in
research
as
universities
typically
pay
to
subscribe
for
access
to

that
is
published
through
traditional

subscriptions

journals
may
be
expensive
for
universities
to
purchase
though
the
articles
are
written
and
peer
reviewed
by
academics
themselves
at
no
cost
to
the
publisher
this
has
led
to
disputes
between
publishers
and
some
universities
over
subscription
costs

as

one
which
occurred
between
the
university

in

for

this
has
been
applied
to
a
range
of
formats
including
textbooks
academic
journals
films
and
music
the
term
was
an
expansion
of
the
related
concept
of
open

software
37
such
content
is
said
to
be
under
an
open

open

website
of
the
open

project
once
defined
open

as
freely
available
for
modification
use
and
redistribution
under
a
license
similar
to
those
used
by
the
open
source
free
software
community
37
however
such
a
definition
would
exclude
the
open
content
license
because
that
license
forbids
charging
for

a
right
required
by
free

open

software
licenses
citation

the
term
since
shifted
in
meaning
open

is
licensed
in
a
manner
that
provides
users
with
free
and
perpetual
permission
to
engage
in
the
5r
activities
38
the
5rs
are
put
forward
on
the
open
content
project
website
as
a
framework
for
assessing
the
extent
to
which
content
is
open
this
broader
definition
distinguishes
open
content
from
open
source
software
since
the
latter
must
be
available
for
commercial
use
by
the
public
however
it
is
similar
to
several
definitions
for
open
educational

which
include

under
noncommercial
and

licenses

historyoriginsthe
concept
of
applying
free
software
licenses
to
content
was
introduced
by
michael
stutz
who
in
1997
wrote
the
paper
applying
copyleft
to
non
software
information
for
the
gnu
project
41
the
term
open
content
was
coined
by
david
a
wiley
in
1998
and
evangelized
via
the
open
content
project
describing
works
licensed
under
the
open
content
license
a
non
free
share
alike
license
see
free
content
below
and
other
works
licensed
under
similar
terms
37
it
has
since
come
to
describe
a
broader
class
of
content
without
conventional
copyright
restrictions
the
openness
of
content
can
be
assessed
under
the
5rs
framework
based
on
the
extent
to
which
it
can
be
reused
revised
remixed
and
redistributed
by
members
of
the
public
without
violating
copyright
law
38
unlike
free
content
and
content
under
open
source
licenses
there
is
no
clear
threshold
that
a
work
must
reach
to
qualify
as
open
content
although
open
content
has
been
described
as
a
counterbalance
to
copyright
open
content
licenses
rely
on
a
copyright
holder
s
power
to
license
their
work
as
copyleft
which
also
utilizes
copyright
for
such
a
purpose
42
in
2003
david
wiley
announced
that
the
open
content
project
had
been
succeeded
by
creative
commons
and
their

wiley
joined
as
director
of

43
44
in
2005
the
open
icecat
project
was
launched
in
which
product
information
for
e
commerce
applications
was
created
and
published
under
the
open

license
it
was
embraced
by
the
tech
sector
which
was
already
quite
open
source
minded
in
2006
a
creative
commons
successor
project
the
definition
of
free

was
introduced
for

45
it
was
put
forth
by
erik
möller
richard
stallman
lawrence
lessig
benjamin
mako
hill
angela
beesley
and
others
46
the
definition
of

is
used
by
the
wikimedia
foundation
47
in
2009
the

creative

were
marked
as

48
another
successor

is

founded
by

in

in

as
a
global
non

to
promote

50
in

the

gave

unifying
both

been
used
