the

of

in

of

appears
to
have
peaked
around

800

were
added
daily
to

was
roughly
800
w

a
team
at

attributed
this
slowing
of
growth
to
the
project
s
increasing
exclusivity
and
resistance
to
change
29
others
suggest
that
the
growth
is
flattening
naturally
because
articles
that

be
called
low
hanging

merit
an

have
already
been
created

unique

committeethe
arbitration
committee
presides
over

ultimate

resolution
process
although
disputes
usually
arise
from
a
disagreement
between
two
opposing
views
on
how
an
article
should
read
the
arbitration
committee
explicitly
refuses
to
directly
rule
on
the
specific
view
that

be
adopted
92
statistical
analyses
suggest
that
the
committee
ignores
the
content
of
disputes
and
rather
focuses
on
the
way
disputes
are
conducted
93
functioning
not
so
much
to
resolve
disputes
and
make
peace
between
conflicting
editors
but
to
weed
out
problematic
editors
while
allowing
potentially
productive
editors
back
in
to
participate

therefore
the
committee
does
not
dictate
the
content
of

it
sometimes
condemns

andrew

a

said
that
the
reason
he
thought
the
number

outnumbered

was

has

the

an

the

the
results
showed
that
the

yielded

the

concluded
that

was
in

faces
a
more
concerning
problem
than

consequently
the
challenge
for

those

to
save

its

of

of
