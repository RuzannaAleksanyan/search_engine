was
an
english
architect
a
rival
of
robert
adam
in
the
neoclassical
and
neo
gothic
styles
he
was
elected
to
the
royal

was

early
classical
career
edit
wyatt
spent
six
years
in
italy
1762
68
in
company
with
richard
bagot
of
staffordshire
who
was
secretary
to
charles
compton
7th
earl
of
northampton
s
embassy
to
the
venetian
republic
in
venice
wyatt
studied
with
antonio
visentini
1688
1782
as
an
architectural
draughtsman
and
painter
in
rome
he
made
measured
drawings
of
the
dome
of
st
peter
s
basilica
being
under
the
necessity
of
lying
on
his
back
on
a
ladder
slung
horizontally
without
cradle
or
side
rail
over
a
frightful
void
of
300
feet
back
in
england
his
selection
as
architect
of
the
proposed
pantheon
or
winter
ranelagh
in
oxford
street
london
brought
him
almost
unparalleled
instant
success
his
brother
samuel
was
one
of
the
principal
promoters
of
the
scheme
and
it
was
doubtless
due
to
him
that
the
designs
of
a
young
and
almost
unknown
architect
were
accepted
by
the
committee
when
the
pantheon
was
opened
in
1772
their
choice
was
at
once
endorsed
by
the
fashionable
public
horace
walpole
pronounced
it
to
be
the
most
beautiful
edifice
in
england
externally
it
was
unremarkable
but
the
classicising
domed
hall
surrounded
by
galleried
aisles
and
apsidal
ends
was
something
new
in
assembly
rooms
and
brought
its
architect
immediate
celebrity
the
design
was
exhibited
at
the
royal
academy
private
commissions
followed
and
at
the
age
of
26
wyatt
found
himself
a
fashionable
domestic
architect
and
on
27
august
1770
an
associate
of
the
royal
academy
2
his
polished
manners
secured
him
friends
as
well
as
patrons
among
the
great
and
when
it
was
rumoured
that
he
was
about
to
leave
the
country
to
become
architect
to
catherine
ii
of
russia
a
group
of
english
noblemen
is
said
to
have
offered
him
a
retaining
fee
of
1
200
to
remain
in
their
service
his
major
neoclassical
country
houses
include
heaton
hall
near
manchester
1772
heveningham
hall
in
suffolk
circa
1788
99
and
castle
coole
in
ireland
as
well
as
packington
hall
staffordshire
the
home
of
the
levett
family
for
generations
and
dodington
park
in
gloucestershire
for
the
codrington
family
on
15
february
1785
wyatt
was
elected
an
academician
of
the
royal
academy

later
classical
work
edit
in
later
years
he
carried
out
alterations
at
frogmore
for
queen
charlotte
and
was
made
surveyor
general
of
the
works
in
about
1800
he
was
commissioned
to
carry
out
alterations
to
windsor
castle
which
would
probably
have
been
much
more
considerable
had
it
not
been
for
george
iii
s
illness
and
in
1802
he
designed
for
the
king
the
strange
castellated
palace
at
kew
which
was
remarkable
for
the
extensive
employment
of
cast
iron
in
its
construction
between
1805
and
1808
wyatt
remodelled
west
dean
house
in
west
dean
west
sussex
wyatt
s
work
was
remarkable
because
it
is
built
entirely
of
flint
even
to
the
door
and
window
openings
which
would
normally
be
lined
with
stone
in
1776
wyatt
succeeded
henry
keene
as
surveyor
to
westminster
abbey
in
which
year
he
was
appointed
elizabeth
countess
of
home
s
architect
on
home
house
though
he
was
sacked
and
replaced
by
robert
adam
a
year
later
in
1782
he
became
in
addition
architect
of
the
ordnance
3
the
death
of
sir
william
chambers
brought
him
the
post
of
surveyor
general
and
comptroller
of
the
works
in
1796
wyatt
was
now
the
principal
architect
of
the
day
the
recipient
of
more
commissions
than
he
could
well
fulfil
his
widespread
practice
and
the
duties
of
his
official
posts
left
him
little
time
to
give
proper
attention
to
the
individual
needs
of
his
clients
as
early
as
1790
when
he
was
invited
to
submit
designs
for
rebuilding
st
chad
s
church
at
shrewsbury
he
broke
his
engagements
with
such
frequency
that
the
committee
became
at
length
offended
and
addressed
themselves
to
mr
george
stewart
in
1804
jeffry
wyatt
told
farington
that
his
uncle
had
lost
many
great
commissions
by
such
neglect
when
approached
by
a
new
client
he
would
at
first
take
the
keenest
interest
in
the
commission
but
when
the
work
was
about
to
begin
he
would
lose
interest
in
it
and
employ
himself
upon
trifling
professional
matters
which
others
could
do
his
conduct
of
official
business
was
no
better
than
his
treatment
of
his
private
clients
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
wyatt
s
irresponsible
habits
which
led
to
the
reorganization
of
the
board
of
works
after
his
death
as
a
result
of
which
the
surveyor
s
office
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
political
chief
assisted
by
three
attached
architects
wyatt
s
work
is
not
characterized
by
any
markedly
individual
style
at
the
time
he
began
practice
the
fashionable
architects
were
the
brothers
adam
whose
style
of
interior
decoration
he
proceeded
to
imitate
with
such
success
that
they
complained
of
plagiarism
in
the
introduction
to
their
works
in
architecture
which
appeared
in
1773
many
years
later
wyatt
himself
told
george
iii
that
there
had
been
no
regular
architecture
since
sir
william
chambers
that
when
he
came
from
italy
he
found
the
public
taste
corrupted
by
the
adams
and
he
was
obliged
to
comply
with
it
much
of
wyatt
s
classical
work
is
in
fact
in
a
chastened
adam
manner
with
ornaments
in
coade
stone
and
etruscan
style
medallions
executed
in
many
cases
by
the
painter
biagio
rebecca
who
was
also
employed
by
his
rivals
it
was
not
until
towards
the
end
of
his
life
that
he
and
his
brother
samuel
with
whom
must
be
associated
their
nephew
lewis
developed
the
severe
and
fastidious
style
of
domestic
architecture
which
is
characteristic
of
the
wyatt
manner
at
its
best
a
but
among
wyatt
s
earlier
works
there
are
several
e
g
the
christ
church
gateway
and
the
mausoleum
at
cobham
which
show
a
familiarity
with
chambers
treatise
on
the
decorative
part
of
civil
architecture
had
he
been
given
the
opportunity
of
designing
some
great
public
building
it
is
possible
that
he
would
have
shown
himself
a
true
disciple
of
chambers
b
but
his
career
as
a
government
architect
coincided
with
the
napoleonic
wars
and
his
premature
death
deprived
him
of
participation
in
the
metropolitan
improvements
of
the
reign
of
george
iv
gothic
architecture
edit
meanwhile
wyatt
s
reputation
as
a
rival
to
robert
adam
had
been
eclipsed
by
his
celebrity
as
a
gothic
architect
every
georgian
architect
was
called
upon
from
time
to
time
to
produce
designs
in
the
medieval
style
and
wyatt
was
by
no
means
the
first
in
the
field
however
whereas
his
predecessors
had
merely
gothicized
their
elevations
by
the
addition
of
battlements
and
pointed
windows
wyatt
went
further
and
exploited
to
the
full
the
picturesque
qualities
of
medieval
architecture
by
irregular
grouping
and
the
addition
of
towers
and
spires
to
his
silhouettes
examples
are
his
fonthill
abbey
wiltshire
and
ashridge
hertfordshire
and
although
crude
in
scale
and
often
unscholarly
in
detail
these
houses
are
among
the
landmarks
of
the
gothic
revival
in
england
in
his
lifetime
wyatt
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
having
revived
in
this
country
the
long
forgotten
beauties
of
gothic
architecture
but
the
real
importance
of
his
gothic
work
lay
in
the
manner
in
which
it
bridged
the
gap
between
the
rococo
gothic
of
the
mid
18th
century
and
the
serious
medievalism
of
the
early
19th
century

his
work

cathedrals
at
salisbury
durham
hereford
and
lichfield
was
bitterly
criticized
by
john
carter
in
his
pursuits
of
architectural
innovation
and
it
was
due
in
large
measure
to
carter
s
persistent
denunciation
that
in
1796
wyatt
failed
to
secure
election
as
a
fellow

the
society

elected
to
the
royal
academy

and
took
an
active
part
in
the
politics
of

was
one
of
the
members
of
the
council
which
attempted
to
assert
its
independence
of
the
general

dissensions
