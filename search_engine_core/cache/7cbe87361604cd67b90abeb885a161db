it
is
anachronistic
to
speak
of
peter
in
terms
of

but
that
christians
of

way
to
the

these
roles

the
christians
refusal

join
pagan

meant
they

catholic

played

in

copied

supported

145
146
the

has
also
been
accused
of
having
encouraged
centuries
of
antisemitism
by
its
teachings
147
and
not
doing
enough
to
stop
nazi
atrocities
148
many
nazi
criminals
escaped
overseas
after

war
also
because
they
had
powerful
supporters
from

vatican
149
150
151
the
judgment
of
pius
xii
is
made
more
difficult
by
the
sources
because
the
church
archives
for
his
tenure
as
nuncio

secretary
of

and

are
in

closed

not
yet

152
the
second
vatican
council
1962
1965
introduced
the
most
significant
changes
to
catholic
practices
since
the
council
of
trent
four
centuries
before
153
initiated
by
pope
john
xxiii
this
ecumenical
council
modernized
the
practices
of
the
catholic
church
allowing
the
mass
to
be
said
in
the
vernacular
local
language
and
encouraging
fully
conscious
and
active
participation
in
liturgical
celebrations
154
it
intended
to
engage
the
church
more
closely
with
the
present
world
aggiornamento
which
was
described
by
its
advocates
as
an
opening
of
the
windows
155
in
addition
to
changes
in
the
liturgy
it
led
to
changes
to
the
church
s
approach
to
ecumenism
156
and
a
call
to
improved
relations
with
non
christian
religions
especially
judaism
in
its
document
nostra
aetate
157
the
council
however
generated
significant
controversy
in
implementing
its
reforms
proponents
of
the
spirit
of
vatican
ii
such
as
swiss
theologian
hans
küng
said
that
vatican
ii
had
not
gone
far
enough
to
change
church
policies
158
traditionalist
catholics
such
as
archbishop
marcel
lefebvre
however
strongly
criticized
the
council
arguing
that
its
liturgical
reforms
led
to
the
destruction
of
the
holy
sacrifice
of
the
mass
and
the
sacraments
among
other
issues
159
the
teaching
on
the
morality
of
contraception
also
came
under
scrutiny
after
a
series
of
disagreements
humanae

upheld
the

s
prohibition
of
all

incarnation
through
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
god
became
united
with
human
nature
through
the
conception
of
christ
in
the
womb
of
the
blessed
virgin
mary
christ
therefore
is
understood
as
being
both
fully
divine
and
fully
human
including
possessing
a
human
soul
it
is
taught
that
christ
s
mission
on
earth
included
giving
people
his
teachings
and
providing
his
example
for
them
to
follow
as
recorded
in
the
four
gospels
252
jesus
is
believed
to
have
remained
sinless
while
on
earth
and
to
have
allowed
himself
to
be
unjustly
executed
by
crucifixion
as
a
sacrifice
of
himself
to
reconcile
humanity
to
god
this
reconciliation
is
known
as
the
paschal
mystery
253
the
greek
term
christ
and
the
hebrew
messiah
both
mean
anointed
one
referring
to
the
christian
belief
that
jesus
death
and
resurrection
are
the
fulfilment
of
the
old
testament
s
messianic
prophecies
254
the
catholic
church
teaches
dogmatically
that
the
holy
spirit
proceeds
eternally
from
the
father
and
the
son
not
as
from
two
principles
but
as
from
one
single
principle
255
it
holds
that
the
father
as
the
principle
without
principle
is
the
first
origin
of
the
spirit
but
also
that
he
as
father
of
the
only
son
is
with
the
son
the
single
principle
from
which
the
spirit
proceeds
256
this
belief
is
expressed
in
the
filioque
clause
which
was
added
to
the
latin
version
of
the
nicene
creed
of
381
but
not
included
in
the
greek
versions
of
the
creed
used
in
eastern
christianity

nature

catholic

258
the
universal
sacrament
of
salvation
for
the
human
race
259
260
and
the
one
true
religion
261
according
to
the
catechism
the
catholic
church
is
further
described
in
the
nicene
creed
as
the
one
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
church
262
these
are
collectively
known
as
the
four
marks
of
the
church
the
church
teaches
that
its
founder
is
jesus
christ
263
42
the
new
testament
records
several
events
considered
integral
to
the
establishment
of
the
catholic
church
including
jesus
activities
and
teaching
and
his
appointment
of
the
apostles
as
witnesses
to
his
ministry
suffering
and
resurrection
the
great
commission
after
his
resurrection
instructed
the
apostles
to
continue
his
work
the
coming
of
the
holy
spirit
upon
the
apostles
in
an
event
known
as
pentecost
is
seen
as
the
beginning
of
the
public
ministry
of
the
catholic
church
45
the
church
teaches
that
all
duly
consecrated
bishops
have
a
lineal
succession
from
the
apostles
of
christ
known
as
apostolic
succession
264
in
particular
the
bishop
of
rome
the
pope
is
considered
the
successor
to
the
apostle
simon
peter
a
position
from
which
he
derives
his
supremacy
over
the
church
265
catholic
belief
holds
that
the
church
is
the
continuing
presence
of
jesus
on
earth
266
and
that
it
alone
possesses
the
full
means
of
salvation
267
through
the
passion
suffering
of
christ
leading
to
his
crucifixion
as
described
in
the
gospels
it
is
said
christ
made
himself
an
oblation
to
god
the
father
to
reconcile
humanity
to
god
268
the
resurrection
of
jesus
makes
him
the
firstborn
from
the
dead
the
first
among
many
brethren
269
by
reconciling
with
god
and
following
christ
s
words
and
deeds
an
individual
can
enter
the
kingdom
of
god
270
the
church
sees
its
liturgy
and
sacraments
as
perpetuating
the
graces
achieved
through
christ
s
sacrifice
to
strengthen
a
person
s
relationship
with
christ
and
aid
in
overcoming
sin
271
final
judgementthe
catholic
church
teaches
that
immediately
after
death
the
soul
of
each
person
will
receive
a
particular
judgement
from
god
based
on
their
sins
and
their
relationship
to
christ
272
273
this
teaching
also
attests
to
another
day
when
christ
will
sit
in
universal
judgement
of
all
mankind
this
final
judgement
according
to
the
church
s
teaching
will
bring
an
end
to
human
history
and
mark
the
beginning
of
both
a
new
and
better
heaven
and
earth
ruled
by
god
in
righteousness
274
depending
on
the
judgement
rendered
following
death
it
is
believed
that
a
soul
may
enter
one
of
three
states
of
the
afterlife
while
the
catholic
church
teaches
that
it
alone
possesses
the
full
means
of
salvation
267
it
also
acknowledges
that
the
holy
spirit
can
make
use
of
christian
communities
separated
from
itself
to
impel
towards
catholic
unity
283
and
tend
and
lead
toward
the
catholic
church
283
and
thus
bring
people
to
salvation
because
these
separated
communities
contain
some
elements
of
proper
doctrine
albeit
admixed
with
errors
it
teaches
that
anyone
who
is
saved
is
saved
through
the
catholic
church
but
that
people
can
be
saved
outside
of
the
ordinary
means
known
as
baptism
of
desire
and
by
pre
baptismal
martyrdom
known
as
baptism
of
blood
as
well
as
when
conditions
of
invincible
ignorance
are
present
although
invincible
ignorance
in
itself
is
not
a
means
of
salvation
284
saints
and
devotionsa
saint
also
historically
known
as
a
hallow
is
a
person
who
is
recognized
as
having
an
exceptional
degree
of
holiness
or
likeness
or
closeness
to
god
while
canonization
is
the
act
by
which
a
christian
church
declares
that
a
person
who
has
died
was
a
saint
upon
which
declaration
the
person
is
included
in
the
canon
or
list
of
recognized
saints
285
286
the
first
persons
honoured
as
saints
were
the
martyrs
pious
legends
of
their
deaths
were
considered
affirmations
of
the
truth
of
their
faith
in
christ
by
the
fourth
century
however
confessors
people
who
had
confessed
their
faith
not
by
dying
but
by
word
and
life
began
to
be
venerated
publicly
in
the
catholic
church
both
in
latin
and
eastern
catholic
churches
the
act
of
canonization
is
reserved
to
the
apostolic
see
and
occurs
at
the
conclusion
of
a
long
process
requiring
extensive
proof
that
the
candidate
for
canonization
lived
and
died
in
such
an
exemplary
and
holy
way
that
he
is
worthy
to
be
recognized
as
a
saint
the
church
s
official
recognition
of
sanctity
implies
that
the
person
is
now
in
heaven
and
that
he
may
be
publicly
invoked
and
mentioned
officially
in
the
liturgy
of
the
church
including
in
the
litany
of
the
saints
canonization
allows
universal
veneration
of
the
saint
in
the
liturgy
of
the
roman
rite
for
permission
to
venerate
merely
locally
only
beatification
is
needed
287
devotions
are
external
practices
of
piety
which
are
not
part
of
the
official
liturgy
of
the
catholic
church
but
are
part
of
the
popular
spiritual
practices
of
catholics
288
these
include
various
practices
regarding
the
veneration
of
the
saints
especially
veneration
of
the
virgin
mary
other
devotional
practices
include
the

fashion

and
believed
as

to

294
further
teachings
include
the
doctrines
of
the
immaculate
conception
her
own
conception
without
the
stain
of
original
sin
and
the
assumption
of

that
her
body
was
assumed
directly
into

at
the
end
of
her
life
both
of
these
doctrines
were
defined
as
infallible
dogma
by
pope
pius
ix
in
1854
and
pope
pius
xii
in
1950
respectively
295
but
only
after

with
the
catholic
bishops
throughout
the
world
to
ascertain
that
this
is
a
catholic
belief
296
in

eastern
catholic
churches

they
continue
to
celebrate
the
feast
of
the
assumption
under
the
name
of
the
dormition
of
the
mother
of
god
on
the

date

that

are

who

304
the
catechism
of
the
catholic
church
categorizes
the
sacraments
into
three
groups
the
sacraments
of
christian
initiation
sacraments
of
healing
and
sacraments
at
the
service
of
communion
and
the
mission
of
the
faithful
these
groups
broadly
reflect
the
stages
of
people
s
natural
and
spiritual
lives
which
each
sacrament
is
intended
to
serve
305
the
liturgies
of
the
sacraments
are
central
to
the
church
s
mission
according
to
the
catechism
in
the
liturgy
of
the
new
covenant
every
liturgical
action
especially
the
celebration
of
the
eucharist
and
the
sacraments
is
an
encounter
between
christ
and
the
church
the
liturgical
assembly
derives
its
unity
from
the
communion
of
the
holy
spirit
who
gathers
the
children
of
god
into
the
one
body
of
christ
this
assembly
transcends
racial
cultural
social
indeed
all
human
affinities
306
according
to
church
doctrine
the
sacraments
of
the
church
require
the
proper
form
matter
and
intent
to
be
validly
celebrated
307
in
addition
the
canon
laws
for
both
the
latin
church
and
the
eastern
catholic
churches
govern
who
may
licitly
celebrate
certain
sacraments
as
well
as
strict
rules
about
who
may
receive
the
sacraments
308
notably
because
the
church
teaches
that
christ
is
present
in
the
eucharist
309
those
who
are
conscious
of
being
in
a
state
of
mortal
sin
are
forbidden
to
receive
the
sacrament
until
they
have
received
absolution
through
the
sacrament
of
reconciliation
penance
310
catholics
are
normally
obliged
to
abstain
from
eating
for
at
least
an
hour
before
receiving
the
sacrament
310
non
catholics
are
ordinarily
prohibited
from
receiving
the
eucharist
as
well
308
311
catholics
even
if
they
were
in
danger
of
death
and
unable
to
approach
a
catholic
minister
may
not
ask
for
the
sacraments
of
the
eucharist
penance
or
anointing
of
the
sick
from
someone
such
as
a
protestant
minister
who
is
not
known
to
be
validly
ordained
in
line
with
catholic
teaching
on
ordination
312
313
likewise
even
in
grave
and
pressing
need
catholic
ministers
may
not
administer
these
sacraments
to
those
who
do
not
manifest
catholic
faith
in
the
sacrament
in
relation
to
the
churches
of
eastern
christianity
not
in
communion
with
the
holy
see
the
catholic
church
is
less
restrictive
declaring
that
a
certain
communion
in
sacris
and
so
in
the
eucharist
given
suitable
circumstances
and
the
approval
of
church
authority
is
not
merely
possible
but
is
encouraged

sacraments
of
initiationbaptismas
viewed
by
the
catholic
church
baptism
is
the
first
of
three
sacraments
of
initiation
as
a
christian
315
it
washes
away
all
sins
both
original
sin
and
personal
actual
sins
316
it
makes
a
person
a
member
of
the
church
317
as
a
gratuitous
gift
of
god
that
requires
no
merit
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
is
baptized
it
is
conferred
even
on
children
318
who
though
they
have
no
personal
sins
need
it
on
account
of
original
sin
319
if
a
new
born
child
is
in
a
danger
of
death
anyone
be
it
a
doctor
a
nurse
or
a
parent
may
baptize
the
child
320
baptism
marks
a
person
permanently
and
cannot
be
repeated
321
the
catholic
church
recognizes
as
valid
baptisms
conferred
even
by
people
who
are
not
catholics
or
christians
provided
that
they
intend
to
baptize
to
do
what
the
church
does
when
she
baptizes
and
that
they
use
the
trinitarian
baptismal
formula
322
confirmationthe
catholic
church
sees
the
sacrament
of
confirmation
as
required
to
complete
the
grace
given
in
baptism
323
when
adults
are
baptized
confirmation
is
normally
given
immediately
afterwards
324
a
practice
followed
even
with
newly
baptized
infants
in
the
eastern
catholic
churches
325
in
the
west
confirmation
of
children
is
delayed
until
they
are
old
enough
to
understand
or
at
the
bishop
s
discretion
326
in
western
christianity
particularly
catholicism
the
sacrament
is
called
confirmation
because
it
confirms
and
strengthens
the
grace
of
baptism
in
the
eastern
churches
it
is
called
chrismation
because
the
essential
rite
is
the
anointing
of
the
person
with
chrism
327
a
mixture
of
olive
oil
and
some
perfumed
substance
usually
balsam
blessed
by
a
bishop
327
328
those
who
receive
confirmation
must
be
in
a
state
of
grace
which
for
those
who
have
reached
the
age
of
reason
means
that
they
should
first
be
cleansed
spiritually
by
the
sacrament
of
penance
they
should
also
have
the
intention
of
receiving
the
sacrament
and
be
prepared
to
show
in
their
lives
that
they
are
christians
329
eucharistfor
catholics
the
eucharist
is
the
sacrament
which
completes
christian
initiation
it
is
described
as
the
source
and
summit
of
the
christian
life
330
the
ceremony
in
which
a
catholic
first
receives
the
eucharist
is
known
as
first
communion
331
the
eucharistic
celebration
also
called
the
mass
or
divine
liturgy
includes
prayers
and
scriptural
readings
as
well
as
an
offering
of
bread
and
wine
which
are
brought
to
the
altar
and
consecrated
by
the
priest
to
become
the
body
and
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
a
change
called
transubstantiation
332
note

the
words
of
consecration
reflect
the
words
spoken
by
jesus
during
the
last
supper
where
christ
offered
his
body
and
blood
to
his
apostles
the
night
before
his
crucifixion
the
sacrament

present
the
sacrifice
of

on
the
cross

ordered

sets

must
follow
358
the

does
not
recognize
divorce
as
ending

allows
state

divorce
only
as
a
means
of
protecting
the

and
well

consideration
of

cases
by

according

it
requires
refraining
from
lust
masturbation
fornication

chastity
for
those
who
are
not
married
requires
living
in
continence
abstaining
from

activity
those
who
are

are
called
to
conjugal
chastity
395
in
the

teaching
sexual
activity
is
reserved
to
married
couples
whether
in
a
sacramental
marriage
among
christians

in

where
one

chastity
in

requires
in

conjugal
fidelity

the
fecundity
of

the

must
foster
trust

honesty
as
well
as

intimacy
sexual

must
always
be
open
to
the
possibility
of

397
the

calls
this
the

significance
it
must
likewise
always
bring

also
teaches

homosexual
acts
are
contrary

acts
of
grave
depravity
and
under
no
circumstances
can
they
be
approved

that
persons
experiencing

tendencies
must
be
accorded
respect
and
dignity
402
according

the
catechism
of

the
number
of
men

women
who
have
deep
seated
homosexual
tendencies
is
not
negligible
this
inclination
which
is
objectively
disordered
constitutes
for
most
of
them
a
trial
they
must
be
accepted
with
respect
compassion
and
sensitivity
every
sign
of
unjust
discrimination
in

should
be
avoided

this
part
of
the
catechism
was
quoted
by
pope
francis
in
a
2013
press
interview
in
which
he
remarked
when
asked
about
an
individual
i
think
that
when
you
encounter
a
person
like
this
the
individual
he
was
asked
about
you
must
make
a
distinction
between
the
fact
of
a
person
being
gay
from
the
fact
of
being
a
lobby
because
lobbies
all
are
not
good
that
is
bad
if
a
person
is
gay
and
seeks
the
lord
and
has
good
will
well
who
am
i
to
judge
them
403
this
remark
and
others
made
in
the
same
interview
were
seen
as
a
change
in
the
tone
but
not
in
the
substance
of
the
teaching
of
the
church
404
which
includes
opposition
to
same
sex
marriage
405
certain
dissenting
catholic
groups
oppose
the
position
of

for

that
the

a
man
and
woman
who
are
married
to
each
other
and
should
be

in
his

413
1968
pope
paul
vi
firmly
rejected
all
contraception
thus
contradicting
dissenters
in
the
church
that
saw
the
birth
control
pill
as
an
ethically
justifiable
method
of
contraception
though
he
permitted
the
regulation
of
births
by
means
of
natural
family
planning
this
teaching
was
continued
especially
by
john
paul
ii
in
his
encyclical
evangelium
vitae
where
he
clarified
the
church
s
position
on
contraception
abortion
and
euthanasia
by
condemning
them
as
part
of
a
culture
of
death
and
calling
instead
for
a
culture

414
many
western
catholics
have
voiced

with

on

a

group
that

stated
in
1998
that
96
of
u
s
catholic
women
had
used
contraceptives
at
some
point
in
their
lives
and
that
72

note

as
catholic
health
providers
are
among
the
largest
providers
of
services
to
patients
with
hiv
aids
worldwide
there
is
significant
controversy
within
and
outside
the
church
regarding
the
use
of
condoms
as
a
means
of
limiting
new
infections
as
condom
use
ordinarily
constitutes
prohibited
contraceptive
use
420
similarly
the
catholic
church
opposes
artificial
insemination
regardless
of
whether
it
is
homologous
from
the
husband
or
heterologous
from
a
donor
and
in
vitro
fertilization
ivf
saying
that
the
artificial
process
replaces
the
love
and
conjugal
act
between
a
husband
and
wife
421
in
addition
it
opposes
ivf
because
it
might
cause
disposal
of
embryos
catholics
believe
an
embryo
is
an
individual
with
a
soul
who
must
be
treated
as
such
422
for
this
reason
the
church
also
opposes
abortion
423
due
to
the
anti
abortion
stance
some
catholics
oppose
receiving
vaccines
derived
from
fetal
cells
obtained
via
abortion
on
21
december
2020
and
regarding
covid
19
vaccination
the
congregation
for
the
doctrine
of
the
faith
emitted
a
document
stating
that
it
is
morally
acceptable
to
receive
covid
19
vaccines
that
have
used
cell
lines
from
aborted
fetuses
in
their
research
and
production
process
when
no
alternative
vaccine
is
available
since
the
moral
duty
to
avoid
such
passive
material
cooperation
is
not
obligatory
if
there
is
a
grave
danger
such
as
the
otherwise
uncontainable
spread
of
a
serious
pathological
agent
424
425
the
document
states
that
receiving
the
vaccine
does
not
constitute
endorsement
of
the
practice
of
abortion
and
that
the
morality
of
vaccination
depends
not
only
on
the
duty
to
protect
one
s
own
health
but
also
on
the
duty
to
pursue
the
common
good
425
the
document
cautions
further
those
who
however
for
reasons
of
conscience
refuse
vaccines
produced
with
cell
lines
from
aborted
fetuses
must
do
their
utmost
to
avoid
by
other
prophylactic
means
and
appropriate
behavior
becoming
vehicles
for
the
transmission
of
the
infectious
agent
in
particular
they
must
avoid
any
risk
to
the
health
of
those
who
cannot
be
vaccinated
for
medical
or
other
reasons
and
who
are
the
most
vulnerable

death
penalty
and
euthanasiathe
catholic
church
is
committed
to
the
worldwide
abolition
of
the
death
penalty
in
any
circumstance
426
the
current
catechism
of
the
catholic
church
teaches
that
in
the
light
of
the
gospel
the
death
penalty
is
inadmissible
because
it
is
an
attack
on
the
inviolability
and
dignity
of
the
person
and
that
the
catholic
church
works
with
determination
for
its
abolition
worldwide
427
in
his
2020
encyclical
fratelli
tutti
francis
repeated
that
the
death
penalty
is
inadmissible
and
that
there
can
be
no
stepping
back
from
this
position
428
on
9
january
2022
pope
francis
stated
in
his
annual
speech
to
vatican
ambassadors
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
employed
for
a
purported
state
justice
since
it
does
not
constitute
a
deterrent
nor
render
justice
to
victims
but
only
fuels
the
thirst
for
vengeance
429
there
is
controversy
about
whether
the
catholic
church
considers
the
death
penalty
intrinsically
evil
430
american
archbishop
josé
horacio
gómez
430
and
catholic
philosopher
edward
feser
argue
that
this
is
a
matter
of
prudential
judgement
and
that
the
church
does
not
teach
this
as
a
de
fide
statement
431
others
such
as
cardinals
charles
maung
bo
and
rino
fisichella
state
that
it
does
430
the
catholic
church
opposes

euthanasia
and
physician
assisted
suicide
on
the
grounds
that
life
is
a
gift
from
god
and
should
not
be
prematurely
shortened

the
church
allows
dying
people
to
refuse
extraordinary
treatments
that
would
minimally
prolong

the
