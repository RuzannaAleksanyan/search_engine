32
two
months
later
gigliotti
and
weiss
initially
selected
actor
and
comedian
kevin
hart
to
host
the
ceremony
34
however
he
resigned
from
his
position
shortly
after
his
selection
after
it
was
revealed
that
hart
made
jokes
that
contained
anti
gay
slurs
and
language
35
36
he
also
added
he
did
not
want
to
be
a
distraction
to
the
ceremony
in
light
of
the
controversy
37
the
following
february
broadcaster
abc
entertainment
chief
karey
burke
announced
that
the
festivities
would
proceed
without
a
host
38
during
an
interview
at
the
television
critics
association
press
tour
burke
stated
the
main
goal
which
i
was
told
was
the
academy
promised
abc
last
year
after
a
very
lengthy
telecast
to
keep
the
show
to
three
hours
producers
wisely
decided
to
not
to
have
a
host
and
to
go
back
to
having
the
presenters
and
movies
be
the
stars
and
that
be
the
best
way
to
keep
the
show
at
a
brisk
three

proposed
popular
film
category
edit
due
to
the
declining
viewership
of
the
recent
academy
awards
ceremonies
ampas
sought
new
ideas
to
revamp
the
show
while
renewing
interest
with
the
nominated
films
in
august
2018
the
organization
announced
plans
to
add
a
new
category
honoring
achievement
in
popular
film
44
the
proposal
was
met
with
criticism
because
the
award
s
implied
focus
on
blockbuster
suggested
that
artistic
films
and
other
non
mainstream
pictures
were
not
popular
with
audiences
45
46
47
furthermore
many
viewed
the
creation
of
this
new
category
to
be
a
ploy
to
boost
ratings
and
that
it
could
hamper
critically
successful
mainstream
films
from
being
nominated
for
best
picture
despite
the
insistence
of
ampas
that
such
movies
could
be
eligible
for
both
categories
45
48
in
light
of
the
backlash
the
academy
announced
the
following
month
that
it
would
postpone
implementation
of
the
new
category
in
order
to
seek
additional
input
49
ampas
president
john
bailey
later
admitted
that
the
proposed
category
was
intended
to
help
improve
viewership
and
noted
that
the
concept
of
a
separate
award
for
commercial
film
dates
back
to
the
inaugural
awards
ceremony
which
had
separate
categories
for
outstanding
picture
and
best
unique
and
artistic
picture

unsuccessful
efforts
to
shorten
the
ceremony
edit
in
an
effort
to
shorten
the
ceremony
it
was
reported
that
only
two
of
the
nominees
for
best
original
song
all
the
stars
and
shallow
would
be
performed
live
51
after
a
negative
reaction
from
audiences
and
industry
musicians
including
lin
manuel
miranda
and
members
of
the
music
branch
the
academy
backtracked
and
announced
that
all
five
best
original

nominees
would
be
performed

the
ceremony
52
53
all
the

said

so
viewers
could
watch
them
live
online
and
that
the
winners
acceptance
speeches
would
be
replayed
later
in

56
the

received
extensive
backlash

some
media
outlets
received
the
broadcast
positively
chuck
barney
of
the
mercury
news
commented
after
months
of
bad
buzz
and
embarrassing
missteps
the
91st
academy
awards
appeared
to
be
on
their
way
to
an
epic
fail
he
also
remarked
the
show
as
usual
had
some
rocky
moments
but
overall
it
was
a
lively
well
paced
and
entertaining
affair
63
television
critic
matthew
gilbert
of
the
boston
globe
wrote
the
hostless
oscar
ceremony
felt
a
little
more
streamlined
and
energetic
than
usual
as
we
were
spared
yet
another
predictable
opening
goof
on
the
nominated
movies
a
monologue
pretending
to
make
fun
of
the
stars
and
short
quips
across
the
night
that
never
quite
land
64
the

critic
daniel

quipped
sunday
s
oscars
telecast
definitely
confirmed
that
under
the
right
circumstances
a
host
isn
t
a
necessity
in
addition
he
said
the
show
was
not
overwhelmed
by
montages
or
stunts
or
tributes
and
it
also
wasn
t
weighed
down
by
elaborately
prepared
presenter
schtick
65
others
were
more
critical
of
the
show
kelly
lawler
of
usa
today
wrote
the
2019
oscar
telecast
lacked
energy
and
comedy
and
was
treacherously
dull
and
maybe
that
could
have
been
avoided
if
the
academy
had
done
what
it
has
almost
always
done
and
procured
a
host
she
also
observed
that
the
awards
were
more
like
a
press
conference
with
movie
clips
in
the
middle
66
television
critic
hank
stuever
of
the
washington
post
commented
they
kept
all
the
speeches
but
lost
any
trace
of
the
unpredictable
magic
they
opened
with
queen
the
actual
band
fronted
by
their
usual
freddie
mercury
replacement
adam
lambert
and
a
promise
that
we
will
rock
you
but
we
all
know
better
the
oscar
telecast
has
never
rocked
anyone
he
ended
his
review
stating
it
s
painful
year
after
year
to
watch
show
business
struggle
to
find
a
better
way
to
put
on
a
satisfying
