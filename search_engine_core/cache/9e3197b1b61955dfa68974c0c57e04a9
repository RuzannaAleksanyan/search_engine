contentsuncrewed
spacecraft
uncrewed
spacecraft
or
robotic
spacecraft
are
spacecraft
without
people
on
board
uncrewed
spacecraft
may
have
varying
levels
of
autonomy
from
human
input
they
may
be
remote
controlled
remote
guided
or
autonomous
they
have
a
pre
programmed
list
of
operations
which
they
will
execute
unless
otherwise
instructed
a
robotic
spacecraft
for
scientific
measurements
is
often
called
a
space
probe
or
space
observatory
many
space
missions
are
more
suited
to
telerobotic
rather
than
crewed
operation
due
to
lower
cost
and
risk
factors
in
addition
some
planetary
destinations
such
as
venus
or
the
vicinity
of
jupiter
are
too
hostile
for
human
survival
given
current
technology
outer
planets
such
as
saturn
uranus
and
neptune
are
too
distant
to
reach
with
current
crewed
spaceflight
technology
so
telerobotic
probes
are
the
only
way
to
explore
them
telerobotics
also
allows
exploration
of
regions
that
are
vulnerable
to
contamination
by
earth
micro
organisms
since
spacecraft
can
be
sterilized
humans
can
not
be
sterilized
in
the
same
way
as
a
spaceship
as
they
coexist
with
numerous
micro
organisms
and
these
micro
organisms
are
also
hard
to
contain
within
a
spaceship
or
spacesuit
the
first
uncrewed
space
mission
was
sputnik
launched
october

1957
to
orbit
the
earth
nearly
all
satellites
landers
and
rovers
are
robotic
spacecraft
not
every
uncrewed
spacecraft
is
a
robotic
spacecraft
for
example
a
reflector
ball
is
a
non
robotic
uncrewed
spacecraft
space
missions
where
other
animals
but
no
humans
are
on

are
called
uncrewed
missions
many
habitable
spacecraft
also
have
varying
levels
of
robotic
features
for
example
the
space
stations
salyut
7
and
mir
and
the
international
space
station
module
zarya
were
capable
of
remote

station
keeping
and
docking
maneuvers
with
both
resupply

and

uncrewed

telepresence
when
the

short

even

integrated

there
are
three
key
parts
in
the
processes
of
landing
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
to
ensure
a
safe
and
successful
landing
20
this
process
includes
an
entry
into
the
planetary
gravity
field
and
atmosphere
a
descent
through
that
atmosphere
towards
an
intended
targeted
region
of
scientific
value
and
a
safe
landing
that
guarantees
the
integrity
of
the
instrumentation
on
the
craft
is
preserved
while
the
robotic
spacecraft
is
going
through
those
parts
it
must
also
be
capable
of
estimating
its
position
compared
to
the
surface
in
order
to
ensure
reliable
control
of
itself
and
its
ability
to
maneuver
well
the
robotic
spacecraft
must
also
efficiently
perform
hazard
assessment
and
trajectory
adjustments
in
real
time
to
avoid
hazards
to
achieve
this
the
robotic
spacecraft
requires
accurate
knowledge
of
where
the
spacecraft
is
located
relative
to
the
surface
localization
what
may
pose
as
hazards
from
the
terrain

and
where
the
spacecraft
should
presently
be
headed
hazard
avoidance
without
the
capability
for
operations
for
localization
hazard
assessment
and
avoidance
the
robotic
spacecraft
becomes
unsafe
and
can
easily
enter
dangerous
situations
such
as
surface
collisions
undesirable
fuel
consumption
levels
and
or
unsafe
maneuvers
telecommunications
edit
components
in
the
telecommunications
subsystem
include
radio
antennas
transmitters
and
receivers
these
may
be
used
to
communicate
with
ground
stations
on

or
with
other
spacecraft
21
electrical
power
edit
the
supply
of
electric
power
on
spacecraft
generally
come
from
photovoltaic
solar
cells
or
from
a
radioisotope
thermoelectric
generator
other
components
of
the
subsystem
include
batteries
for
storing
power
and

circuitry
that
connects

22
temperature
control
and
protection
from
the
environment
edit
spacecraft
are
often
protected
from
temperature
fluctuations
with
insulation
some
spacecraft
use
mirrors
and
sunshades
for
additional
protection
from
solar
heating
they
also
often
need
shielding
from
micrometeoroids
and
orbital
debris
23
propulsion
edit
spacecraft
propulsion
is
a
method
that
allows
a
spacecraft
to
travel
through
space
by
generating
thrust
to
push
it
forward
24
however
there
is
not
one
universally
used
propulsion
system
monopropellant
bipropellant
ion
propulsion
etc
each
propulsion
system
generates
thrust
in
slightly
different
ways
with
each
system
having
its
own
advantages
and
disadvantages
but
most
spacecraft
propulsion
today
is
based
on
rocket
engines
the
general
idea
behind
rocket
engines
is
that
when
an
oxidizer
meets
the
fuel
source
there
is
explosive
release
of
energy
and
heat
at
high
speeds
which
propels
the
spacecraft
forward
this
happens
due
to
one
basic
principle
known
as
newton
s
third
law
according
to
newton
to
every
action
there
is
an
equal
and
opposite
reaction
as
the
energy
and
heat
is
being
released
from
the
back
of
the
spacecraft
gas
particles
are
being
pushed
around
to
allow
the
spacecraft
to
propel
forward
the
main
reason
behind
the
usage
of
rocket
engine
today
is
because
rockets
are
the
most
powerful
form
of
propulsion
there
is
for
a
propulsion
system
to
work
there
is
usually
an
oxidizer
line
and
a
fuel
line
this
way
the
spacecraft
propulsion
is
controlled
but
in
a
monopropellant
propulsion
there
is
no
need
for
an
oxidizer
line
and
only
requires
the
fuel
line
25
this
works
due
to
the
oxidizer
being
chemically
bonded
into
the
fuel
molecule
itself
but
for
the
propulsion
system
to
be
controlled
the
combustion
of
the
fuel
can
only
occur
due
to
a
presence
of
a
catalyst
this
is
quite
advantageous
due
to
making
the
rocket
engine
lighter
and
cheaper
easy
to
control
and
more
reliable
but
the
downfall
is
that
the
chemical
is
very
dangerous
to
manufacture
store
and
transport
a
bipropellant
propulsion
system
is
a
rocket
engine
that
uses
a
liquid
propellent
26
this
means
both
the
oxidizer
and
fuel
line
are
in
liquid
states
this
system
is
unique
because
it
requires
no
ignition
system
the
two
liquids
would
spontaneously
combust
as
soon
as
they
come
into
contact
with
each
other
and
produces
the
propulsion
to
push
the
spacecraft
forward
the
main
benefit
for
having
this
technology
is
because
that
these
kinds
of
liquids
have
relatively
high
density
which
allows
the
volume
of
the
propellent
tank
to
be
small
therefore
increasing
space
efficacy
the
downside
is
the
same
as
that
of
monopropellant
propulsion
system
very
dangerous
to
manufacture
store
and
transport
an
ion
propulsion
system
is
a
type
of
engine
that
generates
thrust
by
the
means
of
electron
bombardment
or
the
acceleration
of
ions
27
by
shooting
high
energy
electrons
to
a
propellant
atom
neutrally
charge
it
removes
electrons
from
the
propellant
atom
and
this
results
the
propellant
atom
becoming
a
positively
charged
atom
the
positively
charged
ions
are
guided
to
pass
through
positively
charged
grids
that
contains
thousands
of
precise
aligned
holes
are
running
at
high
voltages
then
the
aligned
positively
charged
ions
accelerates
through
a
negative
charged
accelerator
grid
that
further
increases
the
speed
of
the
ions
up
to
40
kilometres
per
second
90
000
mph
the
momentum
of
these
positively
charged
ions
provides
the
thrust
to
propel
the
spacecraft
forward
the
advantage
of
having
this
kind
of
propulsion
is
that
it
is
incredibly
efficient
in
maintaining
constant
velocity
which
is
needed
for
deep
space
travel
however
the
amount
of
thrust
produced
is
extremely
low
and
that
it
needs
a
lot
of
electrical
power
to
operate
mechanical
devices
edit
mechanical
components
often
need
to
be
moved
for
deployment
after
launch
or
prior
to
landing
in
addition
to
the
use
of
motors
many
one
time
movements
are
controlled
by
pyrotechnic
devices
28
robotic
vs
uncrewed
spacecraft
edit
robotic
spacecraft
are
specifically
designed
system
for
a
specific
hostile
environment
29
due
to
their
specification
for
a
particular
environment
it
varies
greatly
in
complexity
and
capabilities
while
an
uncrewed
spacecraft
is
a
spacecraft
without
personnel
or
crew
and
is
operated
by
automatic
proceeds
with
an
action
without
human
intervention
or
remote
control
with
human
intervention
the
term
uncrewed
spacecraft
does
not
imply
that
the
spacecraft
is
robotic
control
edit
robotic
spacecraft
use
telemetry
to
radio
back
to

acquired
data
and

although
generally
referred

as

the
earliest

such

sputnik

did
not
receive

signals
from

soon
after
these
first
spacecraft
command
systems
were
developed
to
allow
remote
control
from
the

increased
autonomy
is
important
for
distant
probes

a

32
33
once
a

has
left
the

its
trajectory
will
likely
take
it
along
an
orbit
around
the

similar
to
the
earth
s
orbit
to
reach
another
planet
the
simplest
practical
method
is
a
hohmann
transfer
orbit
more
complex
techniques
such
as
gravitational
slingshots
can
be
more
fuel
efficient
though
they
may
require
the
probe
to
spend
more
time
in
transit
some
high
delta
v
missions
such
as
those
with
high
inclination
changes
can
only
be
performed
within
the
limits
of
modern
propulsion
using
gravitational
slingshots
a
technique
using
very
little
propulsion
but
requiring
a
considerable
amount
of
time
is
to
follow
a
trajectory
