of

45
the

obtained

legitimised

through
its
initial

activities
then
through

scores
of

instituted
50
these

culminated
in
the
establishment
of

of

which
stripped

51
the

occupy
many
fields

out

hitler
told
his

that

needed
to
be
complete
by
1942
as
by
then
the
german
people
would
require

had
advised

in

that

superiority
was

had
never
taken
entirely
seriously
106
107
m
several
historians
including
andrew
gordon
believe
the
primary
reason
for

not
the

of

115
the

was
one
of
surprise
and
trepidation
as

were

about

brought
together
elements

and
combined
them
with

germanism
and
territorial
expansionism
with
the
goal
of
obtaining
more
lebensraum
for
the
germanic
people
171
the
regime
attempted
to
obtain
this
new
territory
by
attacking
poland
and
the
soviet
union
intending
to
mass
murder
or
deport
the
jews
and

living
there
who
it
viewed
as
being
inferior
to
the
aryan
master
race
and
part
of
a
jewish
bolshevik
conspiracy
172
173
the

believed

13
178
creativity
and

were
stifled
except

179
the

used
symbols
such
as
the

the
nazi

rallies
to
foster
unity
and
bolster
the

180
governmenthitler
ruled
germany
autocratically
by
asserting
the
führerprinzip
leader
principle
which
called
for
absolute
obedience
by
all
subordinates
he
viewed
the
government
structure
as
a
pyramid
with
himself
the

leader
at
the
apex
party
rank
was
not
determined
by
elections
and
positions
were
filled
through

by
those
of
higher
rank
181
the
party
used
propaganda
to
develop
a
cult
of
personality
around
hitler
182
historians
such
as
kershaw
emphasise
the
psychological
impact
of
hitler
s
skill
as
an
orator
183
roger
gill
states
his
moving
speeches
captured
the
minds
and
hearts
of
a
vast
number
of
the
german
people
he
virtually
hypnotized
his
audiences
184
while
top
officials
reported
to
hitler
and
followed
his
policies
they
had
considerable
autonomy
185
he
expected
officials
to
work
towards
the
führer
to
take
the
initiative
in
promoting
policies
and
actions
in

with
party
goals
and
hitler
s
wishes
without
his
involvement

decision

186
the
government
was
a
disorganised
collection
of
factions
led
by
the
party
elite
who
struggled
to
amass
power
and
gain
the
führer
s
favour
187
hitler
s
leadership
style
was
to
give
contradictory
orders
to
his
subordinates
and
to
place
them
in
positions
where
their
duties
and
responsibilities
overlapped
188
in
this
way
he
fostered
distrust
competition
and
infighting
among
his
subordinates
to
consolidate
and
maximise
his
own
power
189
successive
reichsstatthalter
decrees
between
1933
and

and
replaced
them
with
new
administrative
divisions
the
gaue
governed
by
nazi
leaders
gauleiters
190
the
change
was
never
fully
implemented
as
the
länder
were
still
used
as
administrative
divisions
for
some
government
departments
such
as
education
this
led
to
a
bureaucratic
tangle
of
overlapping
jurisdictions
and
responsibilities
typical
of
the
administrative
style
of
the

191

civil
servants
and
members
of
the
military
were
required
to
swear

these
laws
became
the
basis
of
the
führerprinzip
the
concept
that
hitler
s
word
overrode
all
existing
laws
194
any
acts
that
were
sanctioned
by
hitler
even
murder
thus
became
legal
195
all
legislation
proposed

had
to
be

by

also
veto

196
most
of
the
judicial
system
and
legal
codes
of
the
weimar
republic
remained
in

to
deal
with
non
political
crimes
197
the
courts
issued
and
carried
out
far
more
death
sentences
than
before
the

took
power
197
people
who
were
convicted
of
three
or
more
offences
even
petty
ones
could
be
deemed
habitual
offenders
and
jailed
indefinitely
198
people
such
as
prostitutes
and
pickpockets
were
judged
to
be
inherently
criminal
and
a
threat
to
the
community
thousands
were
arrested
and
confined
indefinitely
without
trial
199
a
new
type
of
court
the
volksgerichtshof
people
s
court
was
established
in
1934
to
deal
with
political
cases
200
this
court
handed
out
over
5
000
death
sentences
until
its
dissolution
in
1945
201
the
death
penalty
could
be
issued
for
offences
such
as
being
a
communist
printing
seditious
leaflets
or
even
making
jokes
about
hitler
or
other
officials
202
the
gestapo
was
in
charge
of
investigative
policing
to
enforce
nazi
ideology
as
they
located
and
confined
political
offenders
jews
and
others
deemed
undesirable
203
political
offenders
who
were
released
from
prison
were
often
immediately
re
arrested
by
the
gestapo
and
confined
in
a
concentration
camp
204
the
nazis
used
propaganda
to
promulgate
the
concept
of
rassenschande
race
defilement
to
justify
the
need
for
racial
laws
205
in
september
1935
the
nuremberg
laws
were
enacted
these
laws
initially
prohibited
sexual
relations
and
marriages
between
aryans
and
jews
and
were
later
extended
to
include
gypsies
negroes
or
their
bastard
offspring
206
the
law
also
forbade
the
employment
of
german
women
under
the
age
of
45
as
domestic
servants
in
jewish
households
207
the
reich
citizenship
law
stated
that
only
those
of
german
or
related
blood
could
be
citizens
208
thus
jews
and
other
non
aryans
were
stripped
of
their
german
citizenship
the
law
also
permitted
the
nazis
to
deny
citizenship
to
anyone
who
was
not
supportive
enough
of
the
regime
208
a
supplementary
decree
issued
in

defined

anyone

and
the

from
2

1934
members
of
the

forces
were
required
to
pledge
an
oath
of
unconditional
obedience
to
hitler
personally
in
contrast
to
the
previous
oath
which
required
allegiance
to
the
constitution
of
the
country
and
its
lawful
establishments
this
new
oath
required
members
of
the
military
to
obey
hitler
even
if
they
were
being
ordered
to
do
something
illegal
210
hitler
decreed
that
the
army
would
have
to
tolerate
and
even
offer
logistical
support
to
the
einsatzgruppen
the
mobile
death
squads
responsible
for
millions
of

in

it

211
wehrmacht
troops
also
participated
directly
in
the
holocaust
by
shooting
civilians
or
committing
genocide
under
the
guise
of
anti
partisan
operations
212
the
party
line
was
that
the
jews
were
the
instigators
of
the
partisan
struggle
and
therefore
needed
to
be
eliminated
213
on
8
july
1941
heydrich
announced
that
all
jews
in
the
eastern
conquered
territories
were
to
be
regarded
as
partisans
and
gave
the
order
for
all
male
jews
between
the
ages
of
15
and
45
to
be
shot
214
by
august
this
was
extended
to
include
the
entire
jewish
population
215
in
spite
of
efforts
to
prepare
the
country
militarily
the
economy
could
not
sustain
a
lengthy
war
of
attrition
a
strategy
was
developed
based
on
the
tactic
of
blitzkrieg
lightning
war
which
involved
using
quick
coordinated
assaults
that
avoided
enemy
strong
points
attacks
began
with
artillery
bombardment
followed
by
bombing
and
strafing
runs
next
the
tanks
would
attack
and
finally
the
infantry
would
move
in
to
secure
the
captured
area
216
victories
continued
through
mid
1940
but
the
failure
to
defeat
britain
was
the
first
major
turning
point
in
the
war
the
decision
to
attack
the
soviet
union
and
the
decisive
defeat
at
stalingrad
led
to
the
retreat
of
the
german
armies
and
the
eventual
loss
of
the
war
217
the
total
number
of
soldiers
who
served
in

economy
was
a
mixed
economy
that
combined
a

with
central

historian
richard
overy
describes
it
as
being
somewhere
in
between
the
command
economy
of
the
soviet
union
and
the
capitalist
system
of
the
united

265
in

266
wartime
rationing
of

led
to
an
increase
in
personal
savings
funds
which
were
in
turn
lent
to
the
government
to
support
the
war
effort
267
by
1944
the

was
consuming
75
per

of
germany
s

domestic

compared
to
60

in

268
speer
improved

by
centralising
planning
and
control
reducing
production
of
consumer
goods
and
using
forced
labour
and
slavery
269
270
the
wartime
economy
eventually
relied
heavily
upon
the
large
scale
employment
of
slave
labour
germany
imported
and
enslaved
some
12
million
people
from
20
european
countries
to
work
in
factories
and
on

approximately
75

271
many

casualties
of
allied

protection
poor
living
conditions
led
to
high
rates
of
sickness
injury
and
death
as
well
as
sabotage
and
criminal
activity
272
the
wartime
economy
also
relied
upon
large
scale
robbery
initially
through
the
state
seizing
the
property
of
jewish
citizens
and
later
by
plundering
the
resources
of
occupied
territories
273
foreign
workers
brought
into
germany
were
put
into
four
classifications
guest
workers
military
internees
civilian
workers
and
eastern

each
group
was
subject
to
different
regulations
the
nazis
issued
a
ban
on
sexual
relations
between
germans
and
foreign
workers
274
275
by
1944
over
a
half

280
overy
argues
that
the
bombing
strained
the
german
war
economy
and
forced
it
to
divert
up
to
one
fourth
of
its
manpower
and

into

nazi

was
based

the

postulated
the

master
race

inferior
races
particularly
jews
who
were
viewed
as

decided
to
destroy

completely
within

the

was
to

intended
to
create
using

305
to
determine
who
should
be
killed
himmler
created
the
volksliste
a
system
of
classification
of
people
deemed
to
be
of
german
blood
306
he
ordered
that
those
of
germanic
descent
who
refused
to
be
classified
as
ethnic
germans
should
be
deported
to
concentration
camps
have
their
children
taken
away
or
be
assigned
to
forced
labour
307
308
the
plan
also
included
the
kidnapping
of
children
deemed
to
have
aryan
nordic
traits
who
were
presumed
to
be
of
german
descent
309
the
goal
was
to
implement
generalplan
ost
after
the
conquest
of
the
soviet
union
but
when
the
invasion
failed
hitler
had
to
consider
other
options
310
311
one
suggestion
was
a
mass
forced
deportation
of
jews
to
poland
palestine
or
madagascar
302
in
addition
the
nazis
planned
to
reduce
the
population
of
the
conquered
territories
by
30
million
people
through
starvation
in
an
action
called
the
hunger
plan
food
supplies
would
be
diverted
to
the
german
army
and
german
civilians
cities
would
be
razed
and
the
land
allowed
to
return
to
forest
or
resettled
by
german
colonists
312
together
the
hunger
plan
and
generalplan
ost
would
have
led
to
the
starvation
of
80
million
people
in
the
soviet
union
313
these
partially
fulfilled
plans
resulted
in
the
democidal
deaths
of
an

19
3
million
civilians
and

throughout

ussr
and
elsewhere

314
during

the
rest
would

to

318
initially
the
victims
were
murdered
by
einsatzgruppen
firing
squads
then
by
stationary
gas
chambers
or
by

but
these
methods
proved
impractical
for
an

but
enrolment
in

role
of

were
a

the

opposed

was
the

instead
advocating
a

society
in
which
the
german
woman
would
recognise
that
her

is
her

her

her

declined
by
five

355
removing
women
from
the
workforce
did
not
have
the
intended
effect
of
freeing
up
jobs
for
men
as
women
were
for
the
most
part
employed
as
domestic
servants
weavers
or
in
the
food

industries
jobs
that
were
not
of

356
nazi
philosophy
prevented
large
numbers
of
women
from
being
hired
to
work
in
munitions
factories
in
the
build
up
to
the

so
foreign
labourers
were
brought
in

started
slave

were
extensively
used
357
in

1943
hitler
signed
a
decree
requiring
all
women
under
the
age
of
fifty
to
report
for

assignments
to
help

effort
358
thereafter

were
funnelled
into
agricultural
and
industrial
jobs
and
by
september
1944
14
9
million
women
were
working
in

production
359
nazi
leaders
endorsed
the
idea
that
rational
and
theoretical
work
was
alien
to
a
woman
s
nature
and
as
such
discouraged
women
from
seeking
higher
education
360
a
law
passed
in
april
1933
limited
the
number
of
women
admitted
to
university
to
ten
per
cent
of
the
number
of

361
this
resulted
in

in

however
with
the

should
destigmatise
illegitimate

particularly
of

fathered
by

were
vetted

370

370
the
