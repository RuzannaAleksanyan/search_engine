etymologyindeed
the
purpose
of
an
encyclopedia
is
to
collect
knowledge
disseminated
around
the
globe
to
set
forth
its
general
system
to
the
men
with
whom
we
live
and
transmit
it
to
those
who
will
come
after
us
so
that
the
work
of
preceding
centuries
will
not
become
useless
to
the
centuries
to
come
and
so
that
our
offspring
becoming
better
instructed
will
at
the
same
time
become
more
virtuous
and
happy
and
that
we
should
not
die
without
having
rendered
a
service
to
the
human
race
in
the
future

the
word
encyclopedia
encyclo
pedia
comes
from
the
koine
greek
ἐγκύκλιος
παιδεία
13
transliterated
enkyklios
paideia
meaning
general
education
from
enkyklios
ἐγκύκλιος
meaning
circular
recurrent
required
regularly
general
6
14
and
paideia
παιδεία
meaning
education
rearing
of
a
child
together
the
phrase
literally
translates
as
complete
instruction
or
complete
knowledge
15
however
the
two
separate
words
were
reduced
to
a
single
word
due
to
a
scribal
error
16
by
copyists
of
a
latin
manuscript
edition
of
quintillian
in
1470
17
the
copyists
took
this
phrase
to
be
a
single
greek
word
enkyklopaedia
with
the
same
meaning
and
this
spurious
greek
word
became
the
neo
latin
word
encyclopaedia
which
in
turn
came
into
english
because
of
this
compounded
word
fifteenth
century
readers
since
have
often
and
incorrectly
thought
that
the
roman
authors
quintillian
and
pliny
described
an
ancient
genre
18
characteristicsthe
modern
encyclopedia
evolved
from
the
dictionary
in
the
18th
century
this
lineage
can
be
seen
in
the
alphabetical
order
of
print
encyclopedias
19
historically
both
encyclopedias
and
dictionaries
have
been
compiled
by
well
educated
well
informed
content
experts
but
they
are
significantly
different
in
structure
a
dictionary
is
a
linguistic
work
that
primarily
focuses
on
an
alphabetical
listing
of
words
and
their
definitions
synonymous
words
and
those
related
by
the
subject
matter
are
to
be
found
scattered
around
the
dictionary
giving
no
obvious
place
for
in
depth
treatment
thus
a
dictionary
typically
provides
limited
information
analysis
or
background
for
the
word
defined
while
it
may
offer
a
definition
it
may
leave
the
reader
lacking
in
understanding
the
meaning
significance
or
limitations
of
a
term
and
how
the
term
relates
to
a
broader
field
of
knowledge
to
address
those
needs
an
encyclopedia
article
is
typically
not
limited
to
simple
definitions
and
is
not
limited
to
defining
an
individual
word
but
provides
a
more
extensive
meaning
for
a
subject
or
discipline
in
addition
to
defining
and
listing
synonymous
terms
for
the
topic
the
article
can
treat
the
topic
s
more
extensive
meaning
in
more
depth
and
convey
the
most
relevant
accumulated
knowledge
on
that
subject
an
encyclopedia
article
also
often
includes
many
maps
and
illustrations
as
well
as
bibliography
and
statistics
6
an
encyclopedia
is
theoretically
not
written
to
convince
although
one
of
its
goals
is
indeed
to
convince
its
reader
of
its
veracity
wikipedia
co
founder
jimmy
wales
has
said
that
the
goal
of
an
encyclopedia
should
be
to
provide
the
sum
of
all
human
knowledge
but
sum
meaning
summary
20
in
addition
sometimes
books
or
reading
lists
are
compiled
from
a
compendium
of
articles
either
wholly
or
partially
taken
from
a
specific
encyclopedia
four
major
elementsfour
major
elements

an
encyclopedia
its
subject

its

its
method
of
organization
and
its
method
of
production
encyclopedic
dictionariessome
works
entitled
dictionaries
are
similar
to
encyclopedias
especially
those
concerned
with
a
particular
field
such
as
the
dictionary
of
the
middle
ages
the
dictionary
of
american
naval
fighting
ships
and
black
s
law
dictionary
the
macquarie
dictionary
australia
s
national
dictionary
became
an
encyclopedic
dictionary
after
its
first
edition
in
recognition
of
the
use
of
proper
nouns
in
common
communication
and
the
words
derived
from
such
proper
nouns
differences
between
encyclopedias
and
dictionariesthere
are
some
broad
differences
between
encyclopedias
and
dictionaries
most
noticeably
encyclopedia
articles
are
longer
fuller
and
more
thorough
than
entries
in
most
general
purpose
dictionaries
4
21
there
are
differences
in
content
as
well
generally
speaking
dictionaries
provide
linguistic
information
about
words
themselves
while
encyclopedias
focus
more
on
the
things
for
which
those
words
stand
7

10
thus
while
dictionary
entries
are
inextricably
fixed
to
the
word
described
encyclopedia
articles
can
be
given
a
different
entry
name
as
such
dictionary
entries
are
not
fully
translatable
into
other
languages
but
encyclopedia
articles
can
be
7
in
practice
however
the
distinction
is
not
concrete
as
there
is
no
clear
cut
difference
between
factual
encyclopedic
information
and
linguistic
information
such
as
appear
in
dictionaries
9
21
22
thus
encyclopedias
may
contain
material
that
is
also
found
in
dictionaries
and
vice
versa
22
in
particular
dictionary
entries
often
contain
factual
information
about
the
thing
named
by
the
word

encyclopedic
works
were
all

rarely
available
beyond

men
of

they
were
expensive
and
usually
written
for
those
extending

rather
than
those
using
it
during
the

the
creation
of

middle
classes
had
more
time
to
read
and
encyclopedias
helped
them
to
learn
more
publishers
wanted
to
increase
their
output
so
some
countries
like
germany
started
selling
books
missing
alphabetical
sections
to
publish
faster
also
publishers
could
not
afford
all
the
resources
by
themselves
so
multiple
publishers
would
come
together
with
their
resources
to
create
better
encyclopedias
later
rivalry
grew
causing
copyright
to
occur
due
to
weak
underdeveloped
laws

a

encyclopedia
published

30
the
encyclopédie
is
most
famous
for
representing
the
thought
of
the
enlightenment
according
to
denis
diderot
in
the
article
encyclopédie
the
encyclopédies
aim
was
to
change
the
way
people
think
and
for
people
to
be
able
to
inform
themselves
and
to
know

31
he
and
the
other
contributors
advocated
for
the
secularization
of
learning
away
from
the
jesuits
32
diderot
wanted
to
incorporate
all
of
the
world
s
knowledge
into
the
encyclopédie
and
hoped
that
the
text
could
disseminate
all
this
information
to
the
public

future
generations

an
example

online
free
encyclopediasthe
concept
of
a
free
encyclopedia
began
with
the
interpedia
proposal
on
usenet
in
1993
which
outlined
an
internet
based
online
encyclopedia
to
which
anyone
could
submit
content
that
would
be
freely
accessible
early
projects
in
this
vein
included

richard
stallman
proposed
the
gnupedia
an
online
encyclopedia
which
similar
to
the
gnu
operating
system
would
be
a
generic
resource
the
concept
was
very
similar
to
interpedia
but
more
in
line
with
stallman
s
gnu
philosophy
it
was
not
until
nupedia
and
later

that
a
stable
free
encyclopedia
project
was
able
to
be
established

the
internet
