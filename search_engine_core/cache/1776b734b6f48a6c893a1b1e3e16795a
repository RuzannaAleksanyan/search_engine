veered
towards
a

catholic
interpretation

by

catholicism
was
an
essential
part
of
english
life
and
culture
the
9
000
parishes

all
of

were
overseen
by
a
hierarchy
of
deaneries

dioceses
led
by

god

was
given
through

seven
sacraments
10
in
the
mass
a
priest
consecrated
bread
and
wine
to
become
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
through
transubstantiation
the
church
taught
that
in
the
name
of
the
congregation
the
priest
offered
to
god
the
same
sacrifice
of
christ
on
the
cross
that
provided

the
mass
was

of
prayer
by
which
the
living
could
help
souls
in
purgatory
13
while
penance
removed
the
guilt
attached
to
sin
catholicism
taught
that
a
penalty
still
remained
it
was
believed
that
most
people
would
end
their
lives
with
these
penalties
unsatisfied
and
would
have
to
spend
time
in
purgatory
time
in
purgatory
could
be
lessened

indulgences

reformation
edit
in
1527
henry
viii
was
desperate
for
a
male
heir
and
asked
pope
clement
vii
to
annul
his
marriage
to
catherine
of
aragon
when
the
pope
refused
henry
used
parliament
to
assert
royal
authority
over
the
english
church
in
1533
parliament
passed
the
act
in
restraint
of
appeals
barring
legal
cases
from
being
appealed
outside
england
this
allowed
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
to
annul
the
marriage
without
reference
to
rome
in
november
1534
the
act
of
supremacy
formally
abolished
papal
authority
and
declared
henry
supreme
head
of
the
church
of
england
15
henry
s
religious
beliefs
remained
aligned
to
traditional
catholicism
throughout
his
reign
in
order
to
secure
royal
supremacy
over
the
church
however
henry
allied
himself
with
protestants
who
until
that
time
had
been
treated
as
heretics
16
the
main
doctrine
of
the
protestant
reformation
was
justification
by
faith
alone
rather
than
by
good
works
17
the
logical
outcome
of
this
belief
is
that
the
mass
sacraments
charitable
acts
prayers
to
saints
prayers
for
the
dead
pilgrimage
and
the
veneration
of
relics
do
not
mediate
divine
favour
to
believe
they
can
would
be
superstition
at
best
and
idolatry
at
worst

between
1536
and
1540
henry
engaged
in
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
which
controlled
much
of
the
richest
land
he
disbanded
religious
houses
appropriated
their
income
disposed
of
their
assets
and
provided
pensions
for
the
former
residents
the
properties
were
sold
to
pay
for
the

historian
george
w
bernard
argues
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
in
the
late
1530s
was
one
of
the
most
revolutionary
events
in
english
history
there
were
nearly
900
religious
houses
in
england
around
260
for
monks
300
for
regular
canons
142
nunneries

12

people
in

4
000

3
000

3
000

and
2
000

one
adult
man

was
in
religious
orders
20
in
the
reign
of
edward
vi
1547
1553
the
church
of
england
underwent
an
extensive
theological
reformation
justification
by
faith
was
made
a
central
teaching
21
government
sanctioned
iconoclasm
led
to
the
destruction
of
images
and
relics
stained
glass
shrines
statues
and
roods
were
defaced
or
destroyed
church
walls
were
whitewashed
and
covered
with
biblical
texts
condemning
idolatry
22
the
most
significant
reform
in
edward
s
reign
was
the
adoption
of
an
english
liturgy
to
replace
the
old
latin
rites
23
written
by
archbishop
thomas
cranmer
the
1549
book
of
common
prayer
implicitly
taught
justification
by
faith
24
and
rejected
the
catholic
doctrines
of
transubstantiation
and
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
25
this
was
followed
by
a
greatly
revised
1552
book
of
common
prayer
that
was
even
more
protestant
in
tone
going
so
far
as
to
deny
the
real
presence
of
christ
in
the
eucharist
26
27
during
the
reign
of
mary
i
1553
1558
england
was
briefly
reunited
with
the
catholic

it
was
left
to
the
new
regime
of
her
half
sister
queen
elizabeth

resolve
the
direction
of
the
church
the
elizabethan
religious
settlement
returned
the
church
to
where
it
stood
in
1553
before
edward
s
death
the
act
of
supremacy
made
the
monarch
the
church
s
supreme
governor
the
act
of
uniformity
restored
a
slightly
altered
1552
book
of
common
prayer
in
1571
the
thirty
nine
articles
received
parliamentary
approval
as
a
doctrinal
statement
for
the
church
the
settlement
ensured
the
church
of
england
was
protestant
but
it
was
unclear
what
kind
of
protestantism
was
being
adopted
28
the
prayer
book
s
eucharistic
theology
was
vague
the
words
of
administration
neither
affirmed
nor
denied
the
real
presence
perhaps
a
spiritual
presence
was
implied
since
article
28
of
the
thirty
nine
articles
taught
that
the
body
of
christ
was
eaten
only
after
an
heavenly
and
spiritual
manner
29
nevertheless
there
was
enough
ambiguity
to
allow
later
theologians
to
articulate
various
versions
of
anglican
eucharistic
theology
27
the
church
of
england
was
the
established
church
constitutionally
established
by
the
state
with
the
head
of
state
as
its
supreme
governor
the
exact
nature
of
the
relationship
between
church

continued
friction

religious
disputes
often
included
a
political
element
one
example

the
struggle

acted
as

doctrine

practice
edit
the
canon
law
of
the
church
of
england
identifies
the
christian
scriptures
as
the
source
of
its
doctrine
in
addition
doctrine
is
also
derived
from
the
teachings
of
the
church
fathers
and
ecumenical
councils
as
well
as
the
ecumenical
creeds
in
so
far
as
these
agree
with
scripture
this
doctrine
is
expressed
in
the
thirty
nine
articles
of

the
book
of
common
prayer
and
the
ordinal
containing
the
rites
for
the
ordination

57
unlike
other
traditions
the
church
of
england
has
no
single
theologian
that
it
can
look
to
as
a
founder
however
richard

the

continue
to
inform
anglican
identity
the
church
of
england
s
doctrinal
character
today
is
largely
the
result
of
the
elizabethan
settlement
which
sought
to
establish
a
comprehensive
middle
way
between
roman
catholicism
and
protestantism
the
church
of
england
affirms
the
protestant
reformation
principle
that
scripture
contains
all
things
necessary
to
salvation
and
is
the
final
arbiter
in
doctrinal
matters
the
thirty
nine
articles
are
the
church
s
only
official
confessional
statement
though
not
a
complete
system
of
doctrine
the
articles
highlight
areas
of
agreement
with
lutheran
and
reformed
positions
while
differentiating
anglicanism
from
roman
catholicism
and
anabaptism
58
while
embracing
some
themes
of
the
protestant
reformation
the
church
of
england
also
maintains
catholic
traditions
of
the
ancient
church
and
teachings
of
the
church
fathers
unless
these
are
considered
contrary
to
scripture
it
accepts
the
decisions
of
the
first
four
ecumenical
councils
concerning
the
trinity
and
the
incarnation
the
church
of
england
also
preserves
catholic
order
by
adhering
to
episcopal
polity
with
ordained
orders
of
bishops
priests
and
deacons
there
are
differences
of
opinion
within
the
church
of
england
over
the
necessity
of
episcopacy
some
consider
it
essential
while
others
feel
it
is
needed
for
the
proper
ordering
of
the
church
58
in
sum
these
express
the
via
media
viewpoint
that
the
first
five
centuries
of
doctrinal
development
and
church
order
as
approved
are
acceptable
as
a
yardstick
by
which
to
gauge
authentic
catholicity
as
minimum
and
sufficient
anglicanism
did
not
emerge
as
the
result
of
charismatic
leaders
with
particular
doctrines
it
is
light
on
details
compared
to
roman
catholic
reformed
and
lutheran
teachings
the
bible
the
creeds
apostolic
order
and
the
administration
of
the
sacraments
are
sufficient
to
establish
catholicity
the
reformation
in
england
was
initially
much
concerned
about
doctrine
but
the
elizabethan
settlement
tried
to
put
a
stop
to
doctrinal
contentions
the
proponents
of
further
changes
nonetheless
tried
to
get
their
way
by
making
changes
in
church
order
abolition
of
bishops
governance
canon
law
and
liturgy
too
catholic
they
did
not
succeed
because
the
monarchy
and
the
church
resisted
and
the
majority
of
the
population
were
indifferent
moreover
despite
all
the
assumptions
of
the
reformation
founders
of
that
church
it
had
retained
a
catholic
character
the
elizabethan

had

protestant
theology
and
program
within
a
largely
pre

catholic
structure
whose
continuing
life
would
arouse
a
theological
interest
in
the
catholicism
that
had
created
it
and
would
result
in

rejection
of

there

but
a
muddle
that
was

the
story
of
the
english

is
the
tale
of
retreat
from
the
protestant
advance
of
1550
which
could
not
proceed
further
in
the
face

the
church

has
as
one
of
its
distinguishing
marks
a
breadth
of
opinion
from
liberal
to
conservative
clergy
and
members
62
this
tolerance
has
allowed
anglicans
who

the
catholic
tradition

who
emphasise
the

movement
has
stressed
the
importance
of
the

church

the
belief
that
the
ministry
of

deacons
is
a
sign
and
instrument
of
the
church
of
england
s
catholic
and
apostolic
identity
64
the

party
is
more
protestant

has
emphasized

broad
church

been
used
to
describe
those

preferences
who
lean
theologically
towards
liberal
protestantism
66
the
liberal
broad
church
tradition
has
emphasized
the
importance
of
the
use
of
reason
in
theological
exploration
it
has
stressed
the
need
to
develop

to
respond

the
diocese

consecrated
dame
sarah
mullally
as
the
first

as
the
bishop
of
london
90
bishop
sarah
mullally
occupies
the
third
most
senior
position
in
the
church
of
england
91
mullally
has
described
herself
as
a
feminist
and
will
ordain
both
men
and
women
to
the
priesthood
92
she
is
also
considered
by
some
to
be
a
theological
liberal
93
on
women
s
reproductive
rights
mullally
describes
herself
as
pro
choice
while
also
being
personally
pro
life
94
on
marriage
she
supports
the
current
stance
of
the
church
of
england
that
marriage
is
between
a
man
and
a
woman
but
also
said
that
it
is
a
time
for
us
to
reflect
on
our
tradition
and
scripture
and
together
say
how
we
can
offer
a
response
that
is
about
it

same
sex
unions
and
lgbt
clergy
edit
the
church
of
england
has
been
discussing
same
sex
marriages
and
lgbt
clergy
96
97
the
church
holds
that
marriage
is
a
union
of
one
man
with
one
woman
98
99
the
church
does
not
allow
clergy
to
perform
same
sex
marriages
but
in
february
2023
approved
of
blessings
for
same
sex
couples
following
a
civil
marriage
or
civil
partnership
100
101
the
church
teaches
same
sex
relationships
often
embody
genuine
mutuality
and
fidelity
102
103
in
january
2023
the
bishops
approved
prayers
of
thanksgiving
dedication
and
for
god
s
blessing
for
same
sex
couples
104
105
106
the
commended
prayers
of
blessing
for
same
sex
couples
known
as
prayers
of
love
and
faith
may
be
used
during
ordinary
church
services
and
in
november
2023
general
synod
voted
to
authorise
standalone
blessings
for
same
sex
couples
on
a
trial
basis
while
permanent
authorisation
will
require
additional
steps
107
108
the
church
also
officially
supports
celibate
civil
partnerships
we
believe
that
civil
partnerships
still
have
a
place
including
for
some
christian
lgbti
couples
who
see
them
as
a
way
of
gaining
legal
recognition
of
their
relationship
109
civil
partnerships
for
clergy
have
been
allowed
since
2005
so
long
as
they
remain
sexually
abstinent
110
111
112
and
the
church
extends
pensions
to
clergy
in
same
sex
civil
partnerships
113
in
a
missive
to
clergy
the
church
communicated
that
there
was
a
need
for
committed
same
sex
couples
to
be
given
recognition
and
compassionate
attention
from
the
church
including
special
prayers
114
there
is
no
prohibition
on
prayers
being
said
in
church
or
there
being
a
service
after
a
civil
union
115
after
same
sex
marriage
was
legalised
the
church
sought
continued
availability
of
civil
unions
saying
the
church
of
england
recognises
that
same
sex
relationships
often
embody
fidelity
and
mutuality
civil
partnerships
enable
these
christian
virtues
to
be
recognised
socially
and
legally
in
a
proper
framework
116
in
2014
the
bishops
released
guidelines
that
permit
more
informal
kind
of
prayer
for
couples
117
in
the
guidelines
gay
couples
who
get
married
will
be
able
to
ask
for
special
prayers
in
the
church
of
england
after
their
wedding
the
bishops
have
agreed
102
in
2016
the
bishop
of
grantham
nicholas
chamberlain
announced
that
he
is
gay
in
a
same
sex
relationship
and
celibate
becoming
the
first
bishop
to
do
so
in
the
church
118
the
church
had
decided
in
2013
that
gay
clergy
in
civil
partnerships
so
long
as
they
remain
sexually
abstinent
could
become
bishops
112
119
the
house
of
bishops
has
confirmed
that
clergy
in
civil
partnerships
and
living
in
accordance
with
the
teaching
of
the
church
on
human
sexuality
can
be
considered
as
candidates
for
the
episcopate
120
in
2017
the
house
of
clergy
voted
against
the
motion
to
take
note
of
the
bishops
report
defining
marriage
as
between
a
man
and
a
woman
121
due
to
passage
in
all
three
houses
being
required
the
motion
was
rejected
122
after
general
synod
rejected
the
motion
the
archbishops
of
canterbury
and
york
called
for
radical
new
christian
inclusion
that
is
based
on
good
healthy
flourishing
relationships
and
in
a
proper
21st
century
understanding
of
being
human
and
of
being
sexual
123
the
church
officially
opposes
conversion
therapy
a
practice
which
attempts
to
change
a
gay
or
lesbian
person
s
sexual
orientation
calling
it
unethical
and
supports
the
banning
of
conversion
therapy
in
the
uk
124
125
the
diocese
of
hereford
approved
a
motion
calling
for
the
church
to
create
a
set
of
formal
services
and
prayers
to
bless
those
who
have
had
a
same
sex
marriage
or
civil
partnership
126
in
2022
the
house
of
bishops
also
agreed
to
the
formation
of
a
pastoral
consultative
group
to
support
and
advise
dioceses
on
pastoral
responses
to
circumstances
that
arise
concerning

ordinands
lay

and
the
lay
people
in

127
regarding
transgender
issues
the
2017
general
synod
voted
in
favour
of
a
motion
saying
that
transgender
people
should
be
welcomed
and
affirmed
in
their
parish
church
128
129
the
motion
also
asked
the
bishops
to
look
into
special
services
for
transgender
people
130
131
the
bishops
initially
said
the
house
notes
that
the
affirmation
of
baptismal
faith
found
in
common
worship
is
an
ideal
liturgical
rite
which
trans
people
can
use
to
mark
this
moment
of
personal
renewal
132
the
bishops
also
authorised
services
of
celebration
to
mark
a
gender
transition
that
will
be
included
in
formal
liturgy
133
134
transgender
people
may
marry
in
the
church
of
england
after
legally
making
a
transition
135
since
the
gender
recognition
act
2004
trans
people
legally
confirmed
in
their
gender
identity
under
its
provisions
are
able
to
marry
someone
of
the
opposite
sex
in
their
parish
church
136
the
church
further
decided
that
same
gender
couples
may
remain
married
when
one
spouse
experiences
gender
transition
provided
that
the
spouses
identified
as
opposite
genders
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
137
138
since
2000
the
church
has
allowed
priests
to
undergo
gender
transition
and
remain
in
office
139
the
church
has
ordained
openly
transgender
clergy
since
2005
140
the
church
of
england
ordained
the

first
openly
non
binary

141
142
in
january
2023
a
meeting
of
the
bishops
of
the
church
of
england
rejected
demands
for
clergy
to
conduct
same
sex
marriages
however
proposals
would
be
put
to
the
general
synod
that
clergy
should
be
able
to
hold
church
blessings
for
same
sex
civil
marriages
albeit
on
a
voluntary
basis
for
individual
clergy
this
comes
as
the
church
continued
to
be
split
on
same
sex
marriages
143
in
february
2023
ten
archbishops
of
the
global
south
fellowship
of
anglican

released
a
statement
stating
that

had
broken
communion
and
no
longer
recognised
justin
welby
as
the
first
among

or
primus

in

anglican
communion
in
response
to
the
general
synod
s
decision
to
approve
the
blessing
of
same
sex
couples
following
a
civil
marriage
or
partnership
leading
to
questions
as
to
the
status
of
the
church
of
england
as
the
mother
church
of
the
international
anglican
communion
144
145
146
in

the

opposed
to

believes
there
can
be
strictly
limited
conditions
under
which
abortion
may
be
morally
preferable
to
any
available
alternative
150
the
church
also
opposes
euthanasia
its
official
stance
is
that
while
acknowledging
the
complexity
of
the
issues
involved
in
assisted
dying
suicide
and
voluntary
euthanasia
the
church
of
england
is
opposed
to
any
change
in
the
law
or
in
medical
practice
that
would
make
assisted
dying
suicide
or
voluntary
euthanasia
permissible
in
law
or
acceptable
in
practice
it
also
states
that
equally
the
church
shares
the
desire
to
alleviate
physical
and
psychological
suffering
but
believes
that
assisted
dying
suicide
and
voluntary
euthanasia
are
not
acceptable
means
of
achieving
these
laudable
goals
151
in

diocesan
bishops
edit
the
process

historical
reasons

require
royal

rather
than
the

of
the

another
assembly

julie

speaking

in
connection
with
the
dismissals
said
i
think
culturally
we
are
resistant
as
a
church
to
accountability
to
criticism
and
therefore
i
don
t
entirely
trust
the
church
even
though
i
m
a
key
part
of
it

a
leader
within
it
because

the
way
the
wind
blows
is
always
