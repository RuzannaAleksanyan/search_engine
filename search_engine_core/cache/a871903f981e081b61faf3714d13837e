2008
financial

gec
was
the
most
severe
worldwide
economic
crisis
since
the
great

predatory
lending
in
the
form
of
subprime
mortgages
targeting
low

excessive
risk
taking

a
continuous
buildup
of
toxic
assets
within
banks
and
the
bursting
of
the
united
states
housing
bubble
culminated
in
a
perfect
storm
which
led
to
the
great

mortgage
backed
securities
mbs
tied
to
american
real

as
well
as
a
vast
web
of
derivatives
linked
to
those
mbs
collapsed
in
value
financial
institutions
worldwide
suffered
severe
damage

reaching
a
climax
with
the
bankruptcy
of
lehman
brothers
on
september
15
2008
and
a
subsequent
international
banking
crisis
4
the
preconditioning
for
the
financial
crisis
was
complex
and
multi
causal
5
6
7
almost
two
decades
prior
the
u
s
congress
had
passed
legislation
encouraging
financing
for
affordable
housing
8
however
in
1999
parts
of
the
glass
steagall
legislation
which
had
been
adopted
in
1933
were
repealed
permitting
financial
institutions
to
commingle
their
commercial
risk
averse
and
proprietary
trading
risk
taking
operations
9
arguably
the
largest
contributor
to
the
conditions
necessary
for
financial
collapse
was
the
rapid
development
in
predatory
financial
products
which
targeted
low
income
low
information
homebuyers
who
largely
belonged
to
racial
minorities
10
this
market
development
went
unattended
by
regulators
and
thus
caught
the
u
s
government
by
surprise
11
after
the
onset
of
the
crisis
governments
deployed
massive
bail
outs
of
financial
institutions
and
other
palliative
monetary
and
fiscal
policies
to
prevent
a
collapse
of
the
global
financial
system
12
in
the
u
s
the
october
3
800
billion
emergency
economic
stabilization
act
of
2008
failed
to
slow
the
economic
free
fall
but
the
similarly
sized
american
recovery
and
reinvestment
act
of
2009
which
included
a
substantial
payroll
tax
credit
saw
economic
indicators
reverse
and
stabilize
less
than
a
month
after
its
february
17
enactment
13
the
crisis
sparked
the
great
recession
which
resulted
in
increases
in
unemployment
14
and
suicide
15
and
decreases
in
institutional
trust
16
and
fertility
17
among
other
metrics
the
recession
was
a
significant
precondition
for
the
european
debt
crisis
in
2010
the
dodd
frank
wall
street
reform
and
consumer
protection
act
was
enacted
in
the
us
as
a
response
to
the
crisis
to
promote
the
financial
stability
of
the
united

the
crisis
sparked
the

at

was
the
most
severe
global

since

22

it
was
also

in

and
the

icelandic
financial
crisis
which
involved
the
bank
failure
of
all
three
of
the
major
banks
in
iceland
and
relative
to
the
size
of
its
economy
was
the
largest
economic
collapse
suffered
by
any
country
in
history
27
it
was
among
the
five
worst
financial
crises
the
world
had
experienced
and
led
to
a
loss
of
more
than
2
trillion

the
increase
in
cash
out
refinancings
as
home
values
rose
fueled
an
increase
in
consumption
that
could
no
longer
be
sustained
when
home
prices
declined
31
32
33
many
financial
institutions
owned
investments
whose
value
was
based
on
home
mortgages
such
as
mortgage
backed
securities
or
credit
derivatives
used
to
insure
them
against
failure
which
declined
in
value
significantly
34

the
international
monetary
fund
estimated
that
large
u
s
and
european
banks
lost
more
than
1
trillion
on
toxic
assets
and
from
bad
loans
from
january
2007
to
september
2009
37
lack
of
investor
confidence
in
bank
solvency
and
declines
in
credit
availability
led
to
plummeting
stock
and
commodity
prices
in
late
2008
and
early
2009
38
the
crisis
rapidly
spread
into
a
global
economic
shock
resulting
in
several
bank
failures
39
economies

slowed
during
this
period
since
credit
tightened
and

suffered
and

soared
resulting
in

toxic
securities
were
owned
by
corporate
and
institutional
investors
globally
derivatives
such
as
credit
default
swaps
also
increased
the
linkage
between
large
financial
institutions
the
de
leveraging
of
financial
institutions
as
assets
were
sold
to
pay
back
obligations
that
could
not
be
refinanced
in
frozen
credit
markets
further
accelerated
the
solvency
crisis
and
caused
a
decrease
in
international
trade
reductions
in
the
growth
rates
of
developing
countries
were
due
to
falls
in
trade
commodity
prices
investment
and
remittances
sent
from
migrant

50
states
with
fragile
political
systems
feared
that
investors
from
western
states
would
withdraw
their
money
because
of
the
crisis
51
as
part
of
national
fiscal
policy
response
to
the
great
recession
governments
and
central
banks
including
the
federal
reserve
the
european
central
bank
and
the
bank
of
england
provided
then
unprecedented
trillions
of
dollars
in
bailouts
and
stimulus
including
expansive
fiscal
policy
and
monetary
policy
to
offset
the
decline
in
consumption
and
lending
capacity
avoid
a
further
collapse
encourage
lending
restore
faith
in
the
integral
commercial
paper
markets
avoid
the
risk
of
a
deflationary
spiral
and
provide
banks
with
enough
funds
to
allow
customers
to
make
withdrawals
52
in
effect
the
central
banks
went
from
being
the
lender
of
last
resort
to
the
lender
of
only
resort
for
a
significant
portion
of
the
economy
in
some
cases
the
fed
was
considered
the
buyer
of
last
resort
53
54
55
56
57
during
the
fourth
quarter
of
2008
these
central

purchased
us

3
47
trillion
in
2023
trillion
of
government
debt
and
troubled
private
assets
from
banks
this
was
the
largest
liquidity
injection
into
the
credit
market
and
the
largest
monetary
policy
action
in
world
history
following
a
model
initiated
by
the
2008
united
kingdom
bank
rescue
package
58
59
the
governments
of
european
nations
and
the
united
states
guaranteed
the
debt
issued
by
their
banks
and
raised
the
capital
of
their
national
banking
systems
ultimately
purchasing
1
5
trillion
newly
issued
preferred
stock
in
major
banks
44
the
federal
reserve
created
then
significant
amounts
of
new
currency
as
a
method
to
combat
the
liquidity
trap
60
bailouts
came
in
the
form
of
trillions
of
dollars
of
loans
asset
purchases
guarantees
and
direct
spending
61
significant
controversy
accompanied
the
bailouts
such
as
in
the
case
of
the
aig
bonus
payments
controversy
leading
to
the
development
of
a
variety
of
decision
making
frameworks
to
help
balance
competing
policy
interests
during
times
of
financial
crisis

there
is
a
really
good
reason
for
tighter
credit
tens
of
millions
of
homeowners
who
had
substantial
equity
in
their
homes
two
years
ago
have
little
or
nothing
today
businesses
are
facing
the
worst
downturn
since
the
great

this
matters
for
credit
decisions
a
homeowner
with
equity
in
her
home
is
very
unlikely
to
default
on
a
car
loan
or
credit
card
debt
they
will
draw
on
this
equity
rather
than
lose
their
car
and
or
have
a
default
placed
on
their
credit
record
on
the
other
hand
a
homeowner
who
has
no
equity
is
a
serious
default
risk
in
the
case
of

their
creditworthiness

fed
s
action
towards
crisis
edit
the
expansion
of
central
bank
lending
in
response
to
the
crisis
was
not
only
confined
to
the
federal
reserve
s
provision
of
aid
to
individual
financial
institutions
the
federal
reserve
has
also
conducted
a
number
of
innovative
lending
programs
with
the
goal
of
improving
liquidity
and
strengthening
different
financial
institutions
and
markets
such
as
freddie
mac
and
fannie
mae
in
this
case
the
major
problem
among
the
market
is
the
lack
of
free
cash
reserves
and
flows
to
secure
the
loans
the
federal
reserve
took
a
number
of
steps
to
deal
with
worries
about
liquidity
in
the
financial
markets
one
of
these
steps
was
a
credit
line
for
major
traders
who
act
as
the
fed
s
partners
in
open
market
activities
226
also
loan
programs
were
set
up
to
make
the
money
market
mutual
funds
and
commercial
paper
market
more
flexible
also
the
term
asset
backed
securities
loan
facility
talf
was
put
in
place
thanks
to
a
joint
effort
with
the
us
department
of
the
treasury
this
plan
was
meant
to
make
it
easier
for
consumers
and
businesses
to
get
credit
by
giving
americans
who
owned
high
quality
asset
backed
securities
more
credit
before
the
crisis
the
federal
reserve
s
stocks
of
treasury
securities
were
sold
to
pay
for
the
increase
in
credit
this
method
was
meant
to
keep
banks
from
trying
to
give
out
their
extra
savings
which
could
cause
the
federal
funds
rate
to
drop
below
where
it
was
supposed
to
be
227
however
in
october
2008
the
federal
reserve
was
granted
the
power
to
provide
banks
with
interest
payments
on
their
surplus
reserves
this
created
a
motivation
for
banks
to
retain
their
reserves
instead
of
disbursing
them
so
reducing
the
need
for
the
federal
reserve
to
hedge
its
increased
lending
by
decreases
in
alternative
assets
228
money
market
funds
also
went
through
runs
when
people
lost
faith
in
the
market
to
keep
it
from
getting
worse
the
fed
said
it
would
give
money
to
mutual
fund
companies
also
department
of
treasury
said
that
it
would
briefly
cover
the
assets
of
the
fund
both
of
these
things
helped
get
the
fund
market
back
to
normal

the
precipitating
factor
for

2008
was
the
bursting
of
the
united

housing
bubble
and
the
subsequent
subprime

crisis
which
occurred
due
to
a
high
default
rate

adjustable

relaxed

a
contrarian
view
is
that
fannie

led
the

standards
starting
in

by
advocating
the
use
of

automated
underwriting
and

systems
by
designing
no

products
issued
by

by

by
their
close

aggregators

and
does

exonerate
the
cra
they
contend
that
there
were
two
connected
causes
to

the
relaxation
of

standards
in

the
ultra
low
interest
rates
initiated
by
the
federal

attack

causes
had
to
be

288
critics

loan
commitments
were
massive
totaling
4
5

in

years

289
they
also
argue
that
the
federal
reserve
s
classification
of
cra
loans
as
prime
is
based
on
the
faulty
and
self
serving
assumption
that
high

rate
loans
3

wallison
notes
that

countries
had
large
bubbles
during

2007
period
but
the
losses
associated
with
mortgage
delinquencies

when

were
far
lower
than
the
losses
suffered
in
the
united
states
when
the

2007
bubble
deflated
according
to
wallison
the
reason
the
u
s
residential
housing
bubble
as
opposed
to
other
types
of
bubbles
led
to
financial
crisis
was
that
it
was
supported
by
a
huge
number

substandard

generally
with
low
or
no
downpayments
296
krugman

the
growth
of

this

the

all
of
which
have

instead
quiggin
lays
the
blame
for
the
2008
near
meltdown
on
financial

on
political

as
well
as
to
combat
a
perceived

313
as
early
as
2002
it
was
apparent
that
credit
was
fueling
housing
instead
of
business
investment
as
some
economists
went
so
far
as
to
advocate
that
the

needs
to
create
a

bubble
to
replace
the
nasdaq

314
moreover
empirical
studies
using

from

show
that
excessive

growth
contributed
greatly
to
the
severity
of

315
additional
downward
pressure
on

federal

deficits
required

process
bidding
up

and
lowering

316
bernanke
explained
that
between
1996
and
2004
the
u
s
current
account
deficit
increased
by
650
billion
from
1
5
to
5
8
of
gdp
financing
these
deficits
required
the
country
to
borrow
large
sums
from
abroad
much
of
it
from
countries
running
trade
surpluses
these
were
mainly
the
emerging
economies
in
asia
and
oil
exporting
nations
the
balance
of
payments
identity
requires
that
a
country
such
as
the
us
running
a
current
account
deficit
also
have
a
capital
account
investment
surplus
of
the
same
amount
hence
large
and
growing
amounts
of
foreign
funds
capital
flowed
into
the
u
s
to
finance
its
imports
all
of
this
created
demand
for
various
types
of
financial
assets
raising
the
prices
of
those
assets
while
lowering
interest
rates
foreign
investors
had
these
funds
to
lend
either
because
they
had
very
high
personal
savings
rates
as
high
as
40
in
china
or

much
of
this

was
achieved
using
complex
financial
instruments

indeed
we

been
in
the

precisely
this
adverse
feedback
loop
for
more
than
a

a
process
of
balance

deleveraging
has
spread
to
nearly
every
corner
of
the

consumers
are
pulling
back

purchases

on
durable
goods

build
their

businesses
are
cancelling
planned
investments
and
laying
off

are
shrinking

bolster

once

he
spoke

the
paradox
of

the
term
financial

to
the
ongoing

designed
to

client
objectives
such
as
offsetting
a
particular
risk
exposure
such
as
the

examples
pertinent

the

363
this

and
most
importantly
the
computer

while

it
was
the
underestimation

the

that
led
to

369

a

between

professional

combined
with
a
global

in

capital

to

managers
in

credit
assets
professional
investment
managers
generally
are
compensated
based
on
the
volume
of
client
assets
under
management
there
is
therefore
an
incentive
for
asset
managers
to
expand
their
assets
under
management
in
order
to
maximize
their
compensation
as
the
glut
in
global
investment
capital
caused
the
yields
on
credit
assets
to
decline
asset
managers
were
faced
with
the
choice
of
either
investing
in
assets
where
returns
did
not
reflect
true
credit
risk
or
returning
funds
to
clients
many
asset
managers
continued
to
invest
client
funds
in
over
priced
under
yielding
investments
to
the
detriment
of
their
clients
so
they
could
maintain
their
assets
under
management
they
supported
this
choice
with
a
plausible
deniability
of
the
risks
associated
with
subprime
based
credit
assets
because
the
loss
experience
with
early
vintages
of
subprime
loans
was

placed
significant

on
a
run
on
the

in

also
called

these

became
critical
to

but
were
not

further
these

were
vulnerable
because
of

liability
mismatch
meaning
that
they
borrowed
short

to
purchase
long

illiquid

this
meant
that

the

the

of
what
happened
to

he
referred
to
this

in

school
represented
by

pointed
to
capitalism
s
long
term
tendency
of
the
rate
of
profit
to
fall
as
the
underlying
cause
of
crises
generally
from
this
point
of
view
the
problem
was
the
inability
of
capital
to
grow
or
accumulate
at
sufficient
rates
through
productive
investment
alone
low
rates
of
profit
in
productive
sectors
led
to
speculative
investment
in
riskier
assets
where
there
was
potential
for
greater
return
on
investment
the
speculative
frenzy
of
the
late
1990s
and
2000s
was
in
this
view
a
consequence
of
a
rising
organic
composition
of
capital
expressed
through
the
fall
in
the
rate
of
profit
according
to
michael
roberts
the
fall
in

the

time
these

are
known
as

risks
but
perhaps
the
most
important
concern
is
whether

will
be
able
to
provide
liquidity
to

markets
so
that
if
the

financial

indymac
edit
the
first
visible
institution
to
run
into
trouble
in
the
united
states
was
the
southern
california
based
indymac
a
spin
off
of
countrywide
financial
before
its
failure
indymac
bank
was
the
largest
savings
and
loan
association
in
the
los
angeles
market
and
the
seventh
largest
mortgage
loan
originator
in
the
united
states
415
the
failure
of
indymac
bank
on
july
11
2008
was
the
fourth
largest
bank
failure
in
united
states
history
up
until
the
crisis
precipitated
even
larger
failures
416
and
the
second
largest
failure
of
a
regulated
thrift
417
indymac
bank
s
parent
corporation
was
indymac
bancorp
until
the
fdic
seized
indymac
bank

indymac
bancorp
filed
for
chapter

bankruptcy
in
july
2008

indymac
bank
was
founded
as
countrywide
mortgage
investment
in
1985
by
david
s
loeb
and
angelo
mozilo
419
420
as
a
means
of
collateralizing
countrywide
financial
loans
too
big
to
be
sold
to
freddie
mac
and
fannie
mae
in
1997
countrywide
spun
off
indymac
as
an
independent
company
run
by
mike
perry
who
remained
its
ceo
until
the
downfall
of
the
bank
in
july
2008
421
the
primary
causes
of
its
failure
were
largely
associated
with
its
business
strategy
of
originating
and
securitizing
alt
a
loans
on
a
large
scale
this
strategy
resulted
in
rapid
growth
and
a
high
concentration
of
risky
assets
from
its
inception
as
a
savings
association
in
2000
indymac
grew
to
the
seventh
largest
savings
and
loan
and
ninth
largest
originator
of
mortgage
loans
in
the
united
states
during
2006
indymac
originated
over
90

in
2023
of
mortgages
indymac
s
aggressive
growth
strategy
use
of
alt
a
and
other
nontraditional
loan
products
insufficient
underwriting
credit
concentrations
in
residential
real
estate
in
the
california
and
florida
markets
states
alongside
nevada
and
arizona
where
the
housing
bubble
was
most
pronounced
and
heavy
reliance
on
costly
funds
borrowed
from
a
federal
home
loan
bank
fhlb
and
from
brokered
deposits
led
to
its
demise
when
the
mortgage
market
declined
in
2007
indymac
often
made
loans
without
verification
of
the
borrower
s
income
or
assets
and
to
borrowers
with
poor
credit
histories
appraisals
obtained
by
indymac
on
underlying
collateral
were
often
questionable
as
well
as
an
alt
a
lender
indymac
s
business
model
was
to
offer
loan
products
to
fit
the
borrower
s
needs
using
an
extensive
array
of
risky
option
adjustable
rate
mortgages
option
arms
subprime
loans
80
20
loans
and
other
nontraditional
products
ultimately
loans
were
made
to
many
borrowers
who
simply
could
not
afford
to
make
their
payments
the
thrift
remained
profitable
only
as
long
as
it
was
able
to
sell
those
loans
in
the
secondary
mortgage
market
indymac
resisted
efforts
to
regulate
its
involvement
in
those
loans
or
tighten
their
issuing
criteria

risk
officer
to

422

424
on
may
12
2008
in
the
capital
section
of
its
last
10
q
indymac
revealed
that
it
may
not
be
well
capitalized
in
the
future
425
indymac
reported
that
during
april
2008
moody
s
and
standard
poor
s
downgraded
the
ratings
on
a
significant
number
of
mortgage
backed
security
mbs
bonds
including
160
million
222
million
in
2023
issued
by
indymac
that
the
bank
retained
in
its
mbs
portfolio
indymac
concluded
that
these
downgrades
would
have
harmed
its
risk
based
capital
ratio
as
of
june
30
2008
had
these
lowered
ratings
been
in
effect
on
march
31
2008
indymac
concluded
that
the
bank
s
capital
ratio
would
have
been
9
27
total
risk
based
indymac
warned
that
if
its
regulators
found
its
capital
position
to
have
fallen
below
well
capitalized
minimum
10
risk
based
capital
ratio
to
adequately
capitalized
8

risk
based
capital
ratio
the
bank
might
no
longer
be
able
to
use
brokered
deposits
as
a
source
of
funds
senator
charles
schumer
d
ny
later
pointed
out
that
brokered
deposits
made
up
more
than
37
of
indymac
s
total
deposits
and
ask
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
fdic
whether
it
had
considered
ordering
indymac
to
reduce
its
reliance
on
these
deposits
426
with
18
9
billion
in
total
deposits
reported
on
march
31
425
senator
schumer
would
have
been
referring
to
a
little
over
7
billion
in
brokered
deposits
while
the
breakout
of
maturities
of
these
deposits
is
not
known
exactly
a
simple
averaging
would
have
put
the
threat
of
brokered
deposits
loss
to
indymac
at
500
million
a
month
had
the
regulator
disallowed
indymac
from
acquiring
new
brokered
deposits
on
june
30
indymac
was
taking
new
measures
to
preserve
capital
such
as
deferring
interest
payments
on
some
preferred
securities
dividends
on
common
shares
had
already
been
suspended
for
the
first
quarter
of
2008
after
being
cut
in
half
the
previous
quarter
the
company
still
had
not
secured
a
significant
capital
infusion
nor
found
a
ready
buyer
427
indymac
reported
that
the
bank
s
risk
based
capital
was
only
47
million
above
the
minimum
required
for
this
10
mark
but
it
did
not
reveal
some
of
that
47
million
65
3
million
in
2023
capital
it
claimed
it
had
as
of
march
31
2008
was
fabricated
428
when
home
prices
declined
in
the
latter
half
of
2007
and
the
secondary
mortgage
market
collapsed
indymac
was
forced
to
hold
10
7
billion
15
2
billion
in
2023
of
loans
it
could
not
sell
in
the
secondary
market
its
reduced
liquidity
was
further
exacerbated
in
late
june
2008
when
account
holders
withdrew
1
55
billion
2
15
billion
in
2023
or
about
7
5
of
indymac
s
deposits
425
this

followed
the
public
release
of
a
letter
from
senator
charles
schumer
to
the
fdic
and
ots
the
letter
outlined
the
senator
s
concerns
with
indymac
while
the
run
was
a
contributing
factor
in
the
timing
of
indymac
s
demise
the
underlying
cause
of
the
failure
was
the
unsafe
and
unsound
way
it
was
operated
