a
majority
government
is
a
government
by

or
more
governing
parties
that
hold

absolute
majority
of
seats
in
a

such

can
consist
of
one
party
that
holds
a
majority
on
its
own
or
be
a
coalition
government
of
multiple
parties
this
is
as
opposed
to
a
minority
government
where
the
government
doesn
t
have
a
majority
and
needs
to
cooperate
with
opposition
parties
to
get
legislation
passed
a
government
majority
determines
the
balance
of
power

a
government
is
not
a
majority
government
if
it
only
has
a
majority
when
counting
parties
outside
the
government
that
have
a
confidence
agreement
with
it
a
majority
government
is
usually
assured
of
having
its
legislation
passed
and
rarely
if
ever
has
to
fear
being
defeated
in
parliament
a
state
also
known
as
a
working
majority
2
in
contrast
a
minority
government
must
constantly
bargain
for
support
from
other
parties
in
order
to
pass
legislation
and
avoid
being
defeated
on
motions
of
no
confidence
single
party
majority
governments
tend
to
be
formed
in
the
aftermath
of
strong
election
performances
the
term
majority
government
may
also
be
used
for
a
stable
long
term
coalition
of
two
or
more
parties
to
form
an
absolute
majority
one
example
of
such
an
electoral
coalition
is
in
australia
where
the
liberal
and
national
parties
have
run
as
an
electoral
bloc
known
simply
as
the
coalition
for
decades
the
coalition
is
the
only
party
or
coalition
in
australia
to
have
won
at
least
90
of
the
151
seats
in
the
house
of
representatives
at
a
federal
election
this
has
happened
three
times
in
1975
in
1996
and
2013
the
largest
majority
government
in
australia
was
elected
in
1975
when
the
coalition
won
71
65
of
the
seats
in
a
landslide
victory
in
electoral
systems
where
one
party
usually
wins
a
majority
of
seats
on
their
own
such
as
first
past
the
post
coalitions
are
rare
but
may
happen
when
an
election
returns
a
hung
parliament
an
example
of
this
was
the
2010
2015
coalition
government
in
the
united
kingdom
which
was
composed
of
the
conservative
party
and
the
liberal
democrats
the
conservatives
won
the
most
seats
of
any
single
party
in
the
2010
election
but
fell
short
of
an
absolute
majority
however
by
combining
with
the
liberal
democrats
a
solid
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
was
created
this
was
the
first
true
coalition
government
in
the
uk
since
world
war
ii
majority
government
differs
from
consensus
government
or
national
unity
government
in
not
requiring
a
consensus
or
supermajority
