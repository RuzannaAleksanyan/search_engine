architecture
a
choir
also
sometimes
called
quire

is
the
area
of
a
church
or
cathedral
that
provides
seating
for
the
clergy
and
church
choir
it
is
in
the
western
part
of
the
chancel
between
the
nave
and
the
sanctuary
which
houses
the
altar
and
church
tabernacle
in
larger
medieval
churches
it
contained
choir
stalls
seating
aligned
with
the
side
of
the
church
so
at
right
angles
to
the
seating
for
the
congregation
in
the
nave
smaller
medieval
churches
may
not
have
a
choir
in
the
architectural
sense
at
all
and
they
are
often
lacking
in
churches
built
by
all
denominations
after
the
protestant
reformation
though
the
gothic
revival
revived
them
as
a
distinct
feature
as
an
architectural
term
choir
remains
distinct
from
the
actual
location
of
any
singing
choir
these
may
be
located
in
various
places
and
often
sing
from
a
choir
loft
often
over
the
door
at
the
liturgical
western
end
2
in
modern
churches
the
choir
may
be
located
centrally
behind
the
altar
or
the
pulpit
3
the
place
where
the
singers
are
based
is
sometimes
called
the
ritual
choir
as
opposed
to
the
architectural
choir
or
constructional
choir

the
back
choir
or
retroquire
is
a
space
behind
the
high
altar
in
the
choir
of
a
church
in
which
there
may
be
a
small
altar
standing
back
to
back
with
the
other

history
edit
in
the
early
church
the
sanctuary
was
connected
directly
to
the
nave
the
choir
was
simply
the
east
part
of
the
nave
and
was
fenced
off
by
a
screen
or
low
railing
called
cancelli
which
is
where
the
english
word
chancel
comes
from
the
development
of
the
architectural
feature
known
as
the
choir
is
the
result
of
the
liturgical
development
brought
about
by
the
end
of
persecutions
under
constantine
the
great
and
the
rise
of
monasticism
the
word
choir
is
first
used
by
members
of
the
latin
church
isidore
of
seville
and
honorius
of
autun
write
that
the
term
is
derived
from
the
corona
the
circle
of
clergy
or
singers
who
surrounded
the
altar
when
first
introduced
the
choir
was
attached
to
the
bema
the
elevated
platform
in
the
centre
of
the
nave
on
which
were
placed
seats
for
the
clergy
and
a
lectern
for
scripture
readings
this
arrangement
can
still
be
observed
at
the
san
clemente
al
laterano
in
rome

over
time
the
bema
or
presbytery
and
choir
moved
eastward
to
their
current
position
in
some
churches
such
as
westminster
cathedral
the
choir
is
arranged
in
the
apse
behind
the
altar
the
architectural
details
of
the
choir
developed
in
response
to
its
function
as
the
place
where
the
divine
office
was
chanted
by
the
monastic
brotherhood
or
the
chapter
of
canons
the
chancel
was
regarded
as
the
clergy
s
part
of
the
church
and
any
choirboys
from
a
choir
school
counted
as
part
of
the
clergy
for
this
purpose
after
the
reformation
when
the
number
of
clergy
present
even
in
large
churches
and
cathedrals
tended
to
reduce
and
lay
singing
choirs
became
more
frequent
there
were
often
objections
to
placing
them
in
the
traditional
choir
stalls
in
the
chancel
the
pulpit
and
lectern
are
also
usually
found
at
the
front
of
the
choir
though
both
catholic
and
protestant
churches
have
sometimes
moved
the
pulpit
to
the
nave
for
better
audibility
the
organ
may
be
located
here
or
in
a
loft
elsewhere
in
the
church
some
cathedrals
have
a
retro
choir
behind
the
high
altar
opening
eastward
towards
the
chapels
chantries
in
the
eastern
extremity
after
the
reformation
protestant
churches
generally
moved
the
altar
now
often
called
the
communion
table
forward
typically
to
the
front
of
the
chancel
and
often
used
lay
choirs
who
were
placed
in
a
gallery
at
the
west
end
the
choir
and
rear
of
deep
chancels
became
little
used
in
churches
surviving
from
the
middle
ages
and
new
churches
very
often
omitted
one
with
the
emphasis
on
sermons
and
their
audibility
some
churches
simply
converted
their
chancels
to
seat
part
of
the
congregation
in
19th
century
england
one
of
the
battles
of
the
cambridge
camden
society
the
architectural
wing
of
the
anglo
catholics
in
the
church
of
england
was
to
restore
the
chancel
including
the
choir
as
a
necessary
part
of
a
church
by
pushing
the
altar
back
to
its
medieval
position
and
having
the
choir
used
by
a
lay
choir
they
were
largely
successful
in
this
although
the
harder
end
of
the
high
church
objected
to
allowing
a
large
group
of
laity
into
the
chancel
8
different
approaches
to
worship
in
the
20th
century
again
tended
to
push
altars
in
larger
churches
forward
to
be
closer
to
the
congregation
and
the
chancel
again
risks
being
a
less
used
area
of
the
church
seating
edit
the
choir
area
is
occupied
by
sometimes
finely
carved
and
decorated
wooden
seats
known
as
choir
stalls
where
the
clergy
sit
stand
or
kneel
during
services
the
choir
may
be
furnished
either
with
long
benches
pews
or
individual
choir
stalls
there
may
be
several
rows
of
seating
running
parallel
to
the
walls
of
the
church
the
use
of
choir
stalls
as
opposed
to
benches
is
more
traditional
in
monasteries
and
collegiate
churches
monastic
choir
stalls
are
often
fitted
with
seats
that
fold
up
when
the
monastics
stand
and
fold
down
when
they
sit
often
the
hinged
seat
will
have
a
misericord
small
wooden
seat
on
the
underside
on
which
he
can
lean
while
standing
during
the
long
services
the
upper
part
of
the
monk
s
stall
is
so
shaped
as
to
provide
a
headrest
while
sitting
and
arm
rests
when
standing
monasteries
will
often
have
strict
rules
as
to
when
the
monastics
may
sit
and
when
they
must
stand
during
the
services
choir
benches
are
more
common
in
parish
churches
each
bench
may
have
padded
kneelers
attached
to
the
back
of
it
so
that
the
person
behind
may
kneel
at
the
appropriate
times
during
services
the
front
row
will
often
have
a
long
prie
dieu
running
in
front
of
it
for
the
choir
members
to
place
their
books
on
and
which
may
also
be
fitted
with
kneelers
in
a
cathedral
the
bishop
s
throne
or
cathedra
is
usually
located
in
this
space
