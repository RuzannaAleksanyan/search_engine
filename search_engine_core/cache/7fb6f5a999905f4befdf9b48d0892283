background
edit
the
city
of
florence
was
established
in
59
bc
by
julius
caesar
since
846
ad
the
city
had
been
part
of
the
marquisate
of
tuscany
after
margravine
matilda
of
tuscany
died
in
1115
the
city
did
not
submit
readily
to
her
successor
rabodo
r
1116
1119
who
was
killed
in
a
dispute
with
the
city
it
is
not
known
precisely
when
florence
formed
its
own
republican
oligarchical
government
independent
of
the
marquisate
although
the
death
of
rabodo
in
1119
should
be
a
turning
point
the
first
official
mention
of
the
florentine
republic
was
in
1138
when
several
cities
around
tuscany
formed
a
league
against
the
then
margrave
of
tuscany
duke
henry

history
edit
12th
century
edit
the
newly
independent
florence
prospered
in
the
12th
century
through
extensive
trade
with
foreign
countries
this
in
turn
provided
a
platform
for
the
demographic
growth
of
the
city
which
mirrored
the
rate
of
construction
of
churches
and
palazzi
this
prosperity
was
shattered
when
emperor
frederick
i
barbarossa
invaded
the
italian
peninsula
in
1185
as
a
result
the
margraves
of
tuscany
reacquired
florence
and
its
townlands
the
florentines
reasserted
their
independence
when
emperor
henry
vi
died
in
1197
3
13th
century
edit
florence
s
population
continued
to
grow
into
the
13th
century
reaching
30
000
inhabitants
as
has
been
said
the
extra
inhabitants
supported
the
city
s
trade
and
vice
versa
several
new
bridges
and
churches
were
built
most
prominently
the
cathedral
of
santa
maria
del
fiore
begun
in
1294
the
buildings
from
this
era
serve
as
florence
s
best
examples
of
gothic
architecture
politically
florence
was
barely
able
to
maintain
peace
between
its
competing
factions
the
precarious
peace
that
existed
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
was
destroyed
in
1216
when
two
factions
known
as
the
guelphs
and
the
ghibellines
began
to
war
the
ghibellines
were
supporters
of
the
noble
rulers
of
florence
whereas
the
guelphs
were
populists
the
ghibellines
who
had
ruled
the
city
under
frederick
of
antioch
since
1244
were
deposed
in
1250
by
the
guelphs
the
guelphs
led
florence
to
prosper
further
their
primarily
mercantile
orientation
soon
became
evident
in
one
of
their
earliest
achievements
the
introduction
of
a
new
coin
the
florin
in
1252
it
was
widely
used
beyond
florence
s
borders
due
to
its
reliable
fixed
gold
content
and
soon
became
one
of
the
common
currencies
of
europe
and
the
near
east
the
same
year
saw
the
creation
of
the
palazzo
del
popolo
10
the
guelphs
lost
the
reins
of
power
after
florence
suffered
a
catastrophic
defeat
at
the
battle
of
montaperti
against
siena
in
1260
the
ghibellines
resumed
power
and
undid
many
of
the
advances
of
the
guelphs
for
example
the
demolition
of
hundreds
of
towers
homes
and
palaces
the
fragility
of
their
rule
caused
the
ghibellines
to
seek
out
an
arbitrator
in
the
form
of
pope
clement
iv
who
openly
favoured
the
guelphs
and
restored
them
to
power
the
florentine
economy
reached
a
zenith
in
the
latter
half
of
the
13th
century
and
its
success
was
reflected
by
the
building
of
the
famed
palazzo
della
signoria
designed
by
arnolfo
di
cambio
the
florentine
townlands
were
divided
into
administrative
districts
in
1292
in
1293
the
ordinances
of
justice
were
enacted
which
effectively
became
the
constitution
of
the
republic
of
florence
throughout
the
italian
renaissance
11
the
city
s
numerous
luxurious
palazzi
were
becoming
surrounded
by
townhouses
built
by
the
ever
prospering
merchant
class

in
1298
the
bonsignori
family
of
siena
one
of
the
leading
banking
families
of
europe
went
bankrupt
and
the
city
of

lost
its
status
as
the
most
prominent
banking
center
of
europe

14th
century
edit
in
1304
the
war
between
the
ghibellines
and
the
guelphs
led
to
a
great
fire
that
destroyed
much
of
the
city
napier
gives
the
following
account
battles
first
began
between
the
cerchi
and
giugni
at
their
houses
in
the
via
del
garbo
they
fought
day
and
night
and
with
the
aid
of
the
cavalcanti
and
antellesi
the
former
subdued
all
that
quarter
a
thousand
rural
adherents
strengthened
their
bands
and
that
day
might
have
seen
the
neri
s
destruction
if
an
unforeseen
disaster
had
not
turned
the
scale
a
certain
dissolute
priest
called
neri
abati
prior
of
san
piero
scheraggio
false
to
his
family
and
in
concert
with
the
black
chiefs
consented
to
set
fire
to
the
dwellings
of
his
own
kinsmen
in
orto
san
michele
the
flames
assisted
by
faction
spread
rapidly
over
the
richest
and
most
crowded
part
of
florence
shops
warehouses
towers
private
dwellings
and
palaces
from
the
old
to
the
new
market
place
from
vacchereccia
to
porta
santa
maria
and
the
ponte
vecchio
all
was
one
broad
sheet
of
fire
more
than
nineteen
hundred
houses
were
consumed
plunder
and
devastation
revelled
unchecked
amongst
the
flames
whole
races
were
reduced
in
one
moment
to
beggary
and
vast
magazines
of
the
richest
merchandise
were
destroyed
the
cavalcanti
one
of
the
most
opulent
families
in
florence
beheld
their
whole
property
consumed
and
lost
all
courage
they
made
no
attempt
to
save
it
and
after
almost
gaining
possession
of
the
city
were
finally
overcome
by
the
opposite
faction
the
golden
florin
of
the
republic
of
florence
was
the
first
european
gold
coin
struck
in
sufficient
quantities
to
play
a
significant
commercial
role
since
the
7th
century
as
many
florentine
banks
were
international
companies
with
branches
across
europe
the
florin
quickly
became
the
dominant
trade
coin
of
western
europe
for
large
scale
transactions
replacing
silver
bars
in
multiples
of
the
mark
in
fact
with
the
collapse
of
the
bonsignori
family
several
new
banking
families
sprang
up
in
florence
the
bardis
peruzzis
and
the
acciaioli
12
the
friction
between
the
guelphs
and
the
ghibellines
did
not
cease
authority
still
passed
between
the
two
frequently
florence
s
reign
as
the
foremost
banking
city
of
europe
did
not
last
long
the
aforesaid
families
were
bankrupt
in
1340
not
because
of
edward
iii
of
england
s
refusal
to
pay
his
debts
as
is
often
stated
the
debt
was
just
13
000
but
because
of
a
europe
wide
economic
recession
while
the
banks
perished
florentine
literature
flourished
and
florence
was
home
to
some
of
the
greatest
writers
in
italian
history
dante
petrarch
and
boccaccio
they
were
europe
s
first
vernacular
writers
choosing
the
tuscan
dialect
of
italian
which
as
a
result
evolved
into
the
standard
italian
language
over
latin
13
florence
was
hit
hard
by
the
black
death
having
originated
in
the
orient
the
plague
arrived
in
messina
in
1347
the
plague
devastated
europe
robbing
it
of
an
estimated
one
third
of
its
population
14
this
combined
with
the
economic
downturn
took
its
toll
on
the
city
state
the
ensuing
collapse
of
the
feudal
system
changed
the
social
composition
of
europe
forever
it
was
one
of
the
first
steps

and
during

twenty
years
of

were
dominated
by
the
wars
in
lombardy
this
series
of
conflicts
between
the
venetian
republic
and
the
duchy
of
milan
for
hegemony
in
northern
italy
lasted
from
1423
to
1454
and
involved
a
number
of
italian
states
that
occasionally
switched
sides
according
to
their
changing
interests
filippo
maria
visconti
of
milan
invaded
florence
twice
in
the
1430s
and
again
in
1440
but
his
army
was
finally
defeated
in
the
battle
of
anghiari
the
milanese
invasions
were
largely
instigated
by
the
exiled
albizzi
family
28
death
of
filippo
maria
in
1447
led
to
a
major
change
in

alliances
in

current
ally
francesco

established
himself
as

sforza
s
milan
in
the
war
against
venice
while
the
fall
of
constantinople
in
1453
dealt
a
blow
to
venetian
finances
eventually
the
peace
of
lodi
recognized
venetian
and
florentine
territorial
gains
and
the
legitimacy
of
the
sforza
rule
in
milan
29
the
milan
florence
alliance
played
a
major
role
in
stabilizing
the
peninsula
for
the
next
40
years
the
political
crisis
of
1458
was
the
first
serious
challenge
to
the
medici
rule
the
cost
of
wars
had
been
borne
by
the
great
families
of
florence
and
disproportionately
so
by
medici
s
opponents
a
number
of
them
serragli
baroncelli
mancini
vespucci
gianni
were
practically
ruined
and
had
to
sell
their
properties
and
those
were
acquired
by
medici
s
partisans
at
bargain
prices
the
opposition
used
partial
relaxation
of
medici
control
of
the
republic
institutions
30
to
demand
political
reforms
freedom
of
speech
in
the
councils
and
a
greater
share
in
the
decision
making
medici
s
party
response
was
to
use
threats
of
force
from
private
armies
and
milanese
troops
and
arranging
a
popular
assembly
dominated
by
cosimo
s
supporters
it
exiled
the
opponents
of
the
regime
and
introduced
the
open
vote
in
councils
in
order
to
unmask
the
anti
medician
rebels
29
31
from
1458
cosimo
withdrew
from
any
official
public
role
but
his
control
of
florence
was
greater
than
ever
in
the
spring
of
1459
he
entertained
the
new
pope
pius
ii
who
stopped
in
florence
on
his
way
to
the
council
of
mantua
to
declare
a
crusade
against
the
ottomans
and
galeazzo
maria
sforza
francesco
s
son
who
was
to
escort
the
pope
from
florence
to
mantua
in
his
memoirs
pius
said
that
cosimo
was
considered
the
arbiter
of
war
and
peace
the
regulator
of
law
less
a
citizen
than
master
of
his
city
political
councils
were
held
in
his
home
the
magistrates
he
chose
were
elected
he
was

asserted
that
his
tyranny
was
intolerable

political
divisions
of

priest
from

he
came
to
florence

the
1480s
by
proclaiming
predictions
and
through
vigorous
preaching
he
won
the
people
to
his
cause
savonarola
s

government
ushered
in
democratic
reforms
it
allowed
many
exiles
back
into
florence
who
were
banished
by
the
medici
savonarola
s
ulterior
goal
however
was
to
transform
florence
into
a
city
of
god
44
florentines
stopped
wearing
garish
colours
and
many
women
took
oaths

45
savonarola
became
most
famous
for
his
bonfire

the
vanities

he
ordered
all
vanities
to
be
gathered

burned
these
included
wigs
perfume

war
with
pisa
which
had
been
de

independent
since
charles

invasion
three
years

the
endeavour
failed
miserably
and
this
led
to
food
shortages
that
in
turn
led
to
a
few
isolated
cases
of

plague
the
people
blamed
savonarola
for
their
woes

there
was

universal
desire
among
the
people
to
maintain
the
state
in
