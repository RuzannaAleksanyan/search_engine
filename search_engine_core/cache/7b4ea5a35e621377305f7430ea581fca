years

later
life

weir
had
two
significant
advantages
in
his
return
to
a
civilian
career
firstly
he
was
repatriated
well
before
most
servicemen
and
secondly
south
australia
had
implemented
a
policy
of
preferment
of
returned
servicemen
for
government
employment
these
circumstances
helped
him
gain
appointment
as
the
first
south
australian
public
service
commissioner
in
1916
weir
was
not
suited
to
this
role
being
unable
to
navigate
the
competing
personal
and
political
agendas
of
senior
public
servants
and
politicians
and
was
soon
sidelined
2
in
1925
legislative
changes
made
it
possible
for
the
government
to
replace
weir
and
this
took
place
in
1930
in
the
last
year
and
a
half
before
his
retirement
in
