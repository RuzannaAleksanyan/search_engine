war
in
which
all
of
the
stained

was
destroyed
in

contain
some

dating
from
the
1530s
it
came
from
the
abbey
of

having
been
purchased
by

boothby
when
that
abbey

there
were
originally
two
volumes
but
one
went
missing
around
the

early
history
and
elevation
to
archbishopric
edit
when
chad
was
made
bishop
of
mercia
in
669
he
moved
his
see
from
repton
to
lichfield

possibly
because
this
was
already
a
holy
site
as
the
scene
of
martyrdoms
during

roman
period
citation
needed
the
first
cathedral
to
be
built
on
the
present
site
was
in
700
when
bishop
headda
built
a
new
church
to
house
the
bones
of
st
chad
which
had
become
a
sacred
shrine
to
many
pilgrims
when
he

offa
king
of
mercia
seemed
to
resent
his
own
bishops
paying
allegiance
to
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
in
kent
who
whilst
under
offa
s
control
was
not
of
his
own
kingdom
of
mercia
offa
therefore
created
his
own
archbishopric
in
lichfield
who
presided
over
all
the
bishops
from
the
humber
to
the
thames
all
this
began
in
786
with
the
consent
of
pope
adrian
the
pope
s
official
representatives
were
received
warmly
by
offa
and
were
present
at
the
council
of
chelsea
787
often
called
the
contentious
synod
where
it
was
proposed
that
the
archbishopric
of
canterbury
be
restricted
in
order
to
make
way
for
offa
s
new
archbishop
it
was
vehemently
opposed
but
offa
and
the
papal
representatives
defeated
archbishop
jaenbert
installing
higbert
as
the
new
archbishop
of
lichfield
pope
adrian
sent
higbert
the
pallium
denoting
his
support
for
this
move
in
gratitude
offa
promised
to
send
an
annual
shipment
of
gold
to
the
pope
for
alms
and
supplying
the
lights
in
st
peter
s
church
in
rome
however
the
archbishopric
of
lichfield
lasted
for
only
16
years
ending
soon
after
offa
s
death
when
it
was
restored
to
archbishop
aethelheard
of
canterbury

authorities

were
for

but
the
townsfolk
generally
sided
with

the
