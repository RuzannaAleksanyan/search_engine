an
english

her
bravery
in
rescuing

was
a
household
assistant
and

to
the
family
of
her
brother

an

falling
from

window
and
suffering
fatal
injury
britain
in
the
wake
of
the
industrial
revolution
experienced
a
period
of
great
social
change
in
which
the
rapidly
growing
news
media
paid
increasing
attention
to
the
activities
of
the
poorer
classes
the
manner
of
ayres
s
death
caused
great
public
interest
with
large
numbers
of
people
attending
her
funeral
and
contributing
to
the
funding
of
a
memorial
shortly
after
her
death
she
underwent
what
has
been
described
as
a
secular
canonisation
being
widely
depicted
in
popular
culture
and
although
very
little
was
known
about
her
life
widely
cited
as
a
role
model
various
social
and
political
movements
promoted
ayres
as
an
example
of
the
values
held
by
their
particular
movement
the
circumstances
of
her
death
were
distorted
to
give
the
impression
that
she
was
an
employee
willing
to
die
for
the
sake
of
her
employer
s
family
rather
than
for
children
to
whom
she
was
closely
related
in
1902
her
name
was
added
to
the
memorial
to
heroic
self
sacrifice
and
in
1936
a
street
near
the
scene
of
the
fire
was
renamed
ayres
street
in
her
honour
the
case
of
alice
ayres
came
to
renewed
public
notice
with
the
release
of
patrick
marber
s
1997
play
closer
and
the
2004
film
based
on
it
an
important
element
of
the
plot
revolves
around
a
central
character
who
fabricates
her
identity
based
on
the
description
of
ayres
on
the
memorial
to
heroic
self
sacrifice

ayres
wearing
only
a
nightdress
had
tried
to
reach
her
sister
but
was
unable
to
get
to
her
through

smoke

the
crowd
that
had
gathered
outside
the
building
were
shouting
to
ayres
to
jump

instead
she
returned
to
the

shared
with
the
three
young
girls
and
threw
a

out

carefully
dropping

calls
from

left

ellen
clung
to

her
out

fell
onto

was
rushed

a
secular
canonisation
edit
the
british
government
had
traditionally
paid
little
attention
to
the
poor
but
in
the
wake
of
the
industrial
revolution
attitudes
towards
the
accomplishments
of
the
lower
classes
were
changing
the
growth
of
the
railways
the
mechanisation
of
agriculture
and
the
need
for
labour
in
the
new
inner
city
factories
had
broken
the
traditional
feudal
economy
and
caused
the
rapid
growth
of
cities
16
while
increasing
literacy
rates
led
to
a
greater
interest
in
the
media
and
current
affairs
among
ordinary
workers

in
1856
the
first
military
honour
for
bravery
open
to

cross
had
been
instituted
while
in
1866
the
albert
medal

first
official

open
to

of
all

introduced

the
royal

society

and
royal
national

painter

george
frederic
watts
and
his
second
wife

and
artist
mary
fraser
tytler
had
long
been
advocates
of
the
idea
of
art
as
a
force
for
social
change
and
of
the
principle
that
narratives
of

was

since
at
least

he
had
proposed
as
a
companion
piece
a
monument
to
unknown
worth
celebrating
the
bravery
of
ordinary
people
23
on
5
september
1887
a
letter
was
published
in
the
times
from
watts
proposing
a
scheme
to
commemorate
the
golden
jubilee
of
queen
victoria
by
means
of
collecting
and
commemorating
a
complete
record
of
the
stories
of
heroism
in
every
day
life
24
he
cited
the
death
of
alice
ayres
as
an
example
of
the
type
of
event
he
proposed
to
commemorate
and
included
in
his
letter
a
distorted
account
of
ayres
s
actions
during
the
union
street
fire
24
the
roll
would
be
a
long
one
but
i
would
cite
as
an
example
the
name
of
alice
ayres
the
maid
of
all
work
at
an
oilmonger
s
in
gravel
lane
in
april
1885
who
lost
her
life
in
saving
those
of
her
master
s
children
the
facts
in
case
your
readers
have
forgotten
them
were
shortly
these
roused
by
the
cries
of
fire
and
the
heat
of
the
fiercely
advancing
flames
the
girl
is
seen
at
the
window
of
an
upper
story
and
the
crowd
holding
up
some
clothes
to
break
her
fall
entreat
her
to
jump
at
once
for
her
life
instead
she
goes
back
and
reappears
dragging
a
feather
bed
after
her
which
with
great
difficulty
she
pushes
through
the
window
the
bed
caught
and
stretched
the
girl
is
again
at
the
window
a
child
of
three
in
her
arms
which
with
great
care
and
skill
she
throws
safely
upon
the
mattress
twice
again
with
still
older
children
she
repeats
the
heroic
feat
when
her
turn
comes
to
jump
suffocated
or
too
exhausted
by
her
efforts
she
cannot
save
herself
she
jumps
but
too
feebly
falls
upon
the
pavement
and
is
carried
insensibly
to
st
thomas
s
hospital
where
she
dies
watts
had
originally
proposed
that
the
monument
take
the
form
of
a
colossal
bronze
figure
23
but
by
1887
was
proposing
that
the
memorial
take
the
form
of
a
kind
of
campo
santo
consisting
of
a
covered
way
and
marble
wall
inscribed
with
the
names
of
everyday
heroes
to
be
built
in
hyde
park

watts
s
suggestion
was
not
taken
up
27
leading
watts
to
comment
that
if
i
had
proposed
a
race
course
round
hyde
park
there
would
have
been
plenty
of
sympathisers
23

his
high
profile
lobbying
further
raised
the
already
high
public
awareness
of
the
death

ayres
was
coming
to
be
seen
as
a
model
of
british
devotion
to
duty

her
story
was
told
in
collections

her
pure
gentle
life
were
remarked
by
those
around
her
before
there
was
any
thought
of
her
dying
a
heroic
death
so
when
the
great
trial
came
she
was
prepared
and
what
seems
to
us
divine
unselfishness
appeared
to
her
but
simple
duty

one

and
the

was
engaged
in
a
protracted
financial

legal
dispute
over
ownership
of
part
of
the

to
provide
a

justification
for
keeping
the
disputed
land
as

to
raise

profile

the

offered
part

park
as
a
site
for
his
proposed
memorial
watts
agreed

in

the

although
the
public
would
have
been
familiar
with
the
concept
of
a
female
national
heroic
figure
following
the
widespread
coverage
and
public
admiration
of
harriet
newell
grace
darling
and
florence
nightingale
the
ongoing
coverage
of
ayres
and
her
elevation
as
a
national
hero
was
unusual
for
the
period
3
ayres
was
an
uneducated
working
class
woman
who
after
her
death
underwent
what
has
been
described
as
a
secular
canonisation
41
at
a
time
when
despite
the
gradual
formal
recognition
of
the
contributions
of
the
lower
classes
national
heroes
were
generally
male
and
engaged
in
exploration
the
military
religion
or
science
and
engineering
18
this
was
a
period
in
which
political
pressures
for
social
reform
were
growing
the
version
of
ayres
presented
to
the
public
as
a
woman
devoted
entirely
to
duty
embodied
the
idealised
british
character
at
the
time
while
the
image
of
a
hard
working
but
uncomplaining
woman
who
set
the
welfare
of
others
above
her
own
embodied
the
idealised
vision
of
the
working
class
presented
by
social
reformers
and
the
ideal
selfless
and
dedicated
woman
presented
by
campaigners
for
women

rights

at
the
unveiling
of
the
memorial
to
heroic
self
sacrifice
the
lord
mayor
alfred
newton
had
remarked
that
it
was
intended
to
perpetuate
the
acts
of
heroism
which
belonged
to
the
working
classes
42
while
george
frederic
watts
although
he
was
opposed
in
principle
to
discrimination
based
on
class
and
saw
the
memorial
as
being
theoretically
open
to
all
classes
had
remarked
that
the
higher
classes
do
not
or
ought
not
to
require
reminders
or
inducements
42
watts
saw
the
purpose
of
his
memorial
not
as
a
commemoration
of
deeds
but
as
a
tool
for
the
education
of
the
lower
classes
42
watts
s
view
was
shared
by
others
who
sought
to
provide
inspirational
material
on
british
heroes
and
authors
writing
about
ayres
systematically
altered
the
fact
that
the
children
rescued
were
members
of
her
family
instead
describing
them
as
the
children
of
her
employer
43
press
reports
at
the
time
of
the
fire
described
ayres
variously
as
a
little
nursemaid

a
willing
honest
hard
working
servant

and
a
poor
little
domestic

after

unveiling
of

s
panel
acknowledges
in
a
footnote
that
ayres
was
related
to
the
chandlers
45
but
nonetheless
describes
her
as
displaying
the
typical
english
virtues
courage
fortitude
and
an
unquestioning
sense
of
duty
46
while
george
and
mary
watts
and
their
fellow
paternalist
social
reformers
along
with
the
broadly
sympathetic
mainstream
british
press
portrayed

as
an
inspirational
selfless
servant
to

others
had
a
different
view
the
left
wing
reynolds
s
weekly
newspaper
complained
that
the
lack
of
support
for
ayres
s
family
from
the
state
was
symbolic
of
poor
treatment
of
workers
as
a
whole
43
the
pioneering
feminist
periodical
the
englishwoman
s
review
described
their
righteous
pride
at
ayres

instinctive
motherhood
