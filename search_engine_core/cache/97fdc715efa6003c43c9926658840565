initially
hesitant
brolin
for
the
role
he
said
of
his
decision
to
cast
brolin
in
the
leading
role
24
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
the
right
person
although
classically
handsome
i
think
he
would
consider
himself
a
character
actor
first
and
foremost
and
it
was
in
this
context
that
i
thought
of
him
as
w
josh
certainly
has
star
appeal
and
could
be
a
leading
man
but
i
don
t
think
he
necessarily
wants
to
be
that
i
think
he
really
enjoys
disappearing
into
a
character

supremely
effective

calm
