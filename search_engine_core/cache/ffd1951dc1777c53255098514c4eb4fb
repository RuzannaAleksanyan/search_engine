there
have

romano

it

possible
that
a

romano
british

there

called
licidfelth

mentioned
as
the
place

st

fixed

episcopal
see

in

the
first
christian
king
of
mercia
wulfhere
donated
land
at
lichfield
for
st
chad
to
build
a
monastery
it
was
because
of
this
that
the
ecclesiastical
centre
of
mercia
became
settled
as
the
diocese
