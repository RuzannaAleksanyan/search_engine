reptiles
are
reptiles
which
have
become
secondarily
adapted
for
an
aquatic
or
semiaquatic
life
in
a
marine
environment
only
about
100
of
the
12
000
extant
reptile
species
and
subspecies
are
classed
as
marine
reptiles
including
marine
iguanas
sea
snakes
sea
turtles
and
saltwater
crocodiles
1
the
earliest
marine
reptile
was
mesosaurus
not
to
be
confused
with
mosasaurus
which
arose
in
the
permian
period
of
the
paleozoic
era
2
during
the
mesozoic
era
many
groups
of
reptiles
became
adapted
to
life
in
the
seas
including
such
familiar
clades
as
the
ichthyosaurs
plesiosaurs
these
two
orders
were
once
thought
united
in
the
group
enaliosauria

a
classification
now
cladistically
obsolete
mosasaurs
nothosaurs
placodonts
sea
turtles
thalattosaurs
and
thalattosuchians
most
marine
reptile
groups
became
extinct
at
the
end
of
the
cretaceous
period
but
some
still
existed
during
the
cenozoic
most
importantly
the
sea
turtles
other
cenozoic
marine
reptiles
included
the
bothremydids
4
palaeophiid
snakes
a
few
choristoderes
such
as
simoedosaurus
and
dyrosaurid
crocodylomorphs
various
types
of
marine
gavialid
crocodilians
remained
widespread
as
recently
as
the
late
miocene
5
some
marine
reptiles
such
as
ichthyosaurs
plesiosaurs
metriorhynchid
thalattosuchians
and
mosasaurs
became
so
well
adapted
to
a
marine
lifestyle
that
they
were
incapable
of
venturing
onto
land
and
gave
birth
in
the
water
others
such
as
sea
turtles
and
saltwater
crocodiles
return
to
shore
to
lay
their
eggs
some
marine
reptiles

occasionally
rest
and
bask

most
species
of
marine
reptiles
are
considered
endangered
to
some
degree
all
but
one
species
of
sea
turtles
are
endangered
due
to
destruction
of
nesting
habitats
on
coastal
lands
exploitation
and
marine
fishing
6
many
species
of
sea
snakes
are
threatened
or
endangered
due
to
commercial
exploitation
sale
of
skins
and
pollution
especially
in
asia
marine
iguanas
are
threatened
due
to
their
very
limited
habitation
range
1
saltwater
crocodiles
are
at
low
risk
for
extinction
