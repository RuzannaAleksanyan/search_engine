nagoya

was
a
busy
international

the

has
been

the
cargo
handling
capacity
of
nagoya
airport
was
not
enough
to
satisfy
the
demands
from
the
regional
economy
and
air
cargo
shifted
to
narita
and
kansai
in
addition
the
airport
was
hampered
by
its
location
in
a
residential
area
of
aichi
prefecture
limiting
the
number
of
flights
that
can
use
the
airport
as
well
as
the
hours
in
which
they
can
fly
because
of
these
reasons
a
new
airport
chubu

was
built
on
an
island
south
of

on

nearly
all

moved

the

opened
a

at

a

restructuring
