fox
opted
to

independent
station
in
markets
where
a
more
established
independent
declined
the
affiliation
such
as
denver

largely
because
of
both
these
factors
fox
in
a
situation
very
similar

decades
before

little
choice

p

eastern

on
thursday
october

1986

program
was

night
talk
show

late
show
which
was
hosted
by
comedian
joan
rivers
14

after
a
strong
start
the
late
show
quickly
eroded
in
the
ratings
it
was
never
able
to
overtake
nbc
stalwart
the
tonight
show
by
early
1987
rivers
and
her
then
husband
edgar
rosenberg
the
show
s
original
executive
producer
quit
the
late
show
after
disagreements
with
the
network
over
the
show
s
creative
direction
the
program
then
began
to
be
hosted
by
a
succession
of
guest
hosts
after
that
point
some
stations
that
affiliated
with
fbc
in
the
weeks
before
the
april
1987
launch
of
its
prime
time
lineup
such
as
wcgv
tv
in
milwaukee
and
wdrb
tv
in
louisville
signed
affiliation
agreements
with
the
network
on
the
condition
that
they
would
not
have
to
carry
the
late
show
due
to
the
program
s
weak
ratings
shortly
before
the
official
launch
of
fbc
on
april
5
1987
under
original
fox
entertainment
president
garth
ancier
the
network
underwent
a
re
branding
to
the
much
shorter
fox
according
to
an
interview
ancier
gave
at
that
time
it
was
ad
man
jay
chiat
who
suggested
to
network
executives
that
rather
than
create
a
brand
from
scratch
the
network
ought
to
use
the
fox
heritage
of
the
previous
80
years
and
the
searchlight
iconography
to
link
fox
broadcasting
to
20th
century

16
until
late
in
the
game
during
the
1980s
several
station
groups

rise
into
mainstream

beginnings

rivalry
with
the

edit
fox
survived
where
dumont
and
other
attempts
to
start
a
fourth
network
had
failed
because
it
programmed
just
under
the
number
of
hours
defined
by
the
fcc
to
legally
be
considered
a
network
this
allowed
fox
to
make
revenue
in
ways
forbidden
to
the
established
networks
for
instance
it
did
not
have
to
adhere
to
the
financial
interest
and
syndication
rules
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
since
during
its
first
years
it
was
considered
to
be
merely
a
large
group
of
stations
by
comparison
dumont
had
been
saddled
by
numerous
regulatory
barriers
that
hampered
its
potential
to
grow
most
notably
a
ban
on
acquiring
additional
stations
during
an
era
when
the
fcc
had
much
tighter
ownership
limits
for
television
stations
limiting
broadcasters
to
a
maximum
of
five
stations
nationwide
than
it
did
when
fox
launched
in
addition
murdoch
was
more
than
willing
to
open
his
wallet
to
get
and
keep
programming
and
talent
dumont
in
contrast
operated
on
a
shoestring
budget
and
was
unable
to
keep
the
programs
and
stars
it
had
23
most
of
the
other
startup
networks
that
launched
in
later
years
such
as
upn
and
the
wb
followed
fox
s
model
as
well
furthermore
dumont
operated
during
a
time
when
the
fcc
did
not
require
television
manufacturers
to
include
uhf
capability
24
in
order
to
see
dumont
s
uhf
stations
most
people
had
to
buy
an
expensive
converter
even
then
the
signal
quality
was
marginal
at
best
compared
to
the
signals
of
vhf
stations
see

broadcasting
uhf
vs
vhf
by
the
time
fox
launched
cable
allowed
uhf
stations
to
generally
be
on
an
equal
footing
with
vhf
stations
13
although
fox
was
growing
rapidly
as
a
network
and
had
established
itself
as
a
presence
it
was
still
not
considered
a
major
competitor
to
the
established
big
three
broadcast
networks
abc
cbs
and
nbc
from
its
launch
fox
had
the
advantage
of
offering
programs
intended
to
appeal
toward
a
younger
demographic
adults
between
18
and
34
years
of
age
and
that
were
edgier
in
content
whereas
some
programs
that
were
carried
by
the
big
three
networks
attracted
an
older
skewing
audience
until
the
early
1990s
when
fox
expanded
its
programming
to
additional
nights
and
outside
prime
time
most
fox
stations
were
still
essentially
formatted
as
independent
stations
filling
their
schedules
with
mainly
first
run
and
acquired
programming
and
during
prime
time
running
either
syndicated
programs
or
more
commonly
movies
on
nights
when
the
network
did
not
provide
programming
few
fox
stations
carried
local
newscasts
during
the
network
s
early
years
unlike
the
owned
and
operated
stations
and
affiliates
of
its
established
rivals
those
that
did
were
mostly
based

were
not

the
affiliation
moved
from

entirely
eschewed

the

was
the
impetus
for
the
affiliation
deal
with
new
world
33
and
sf
broadcasting
s
purchase
of
the
burnham
stations
as
fox
sought
to
improve
local
coverage
of
its
new
nfl
package
by
aligning
the
network
with
stations
that
had
more
established
histories
and
advertiser
value
than
its
charter
affiliates
the
deals
spurred
a
series
of
affiliation
realignments
between
all
four
u

television
networks
involving
individual
stations
and
various
broadcasting
groups
such
as
those

bought
the

abc
and
the
e
w
scripps
company
which
owned
three
fox
affiliates
that
switched
to
either
abc

a
result
of
the
new
world
deal
affecting
30
television
markets
between
september
1994

1996
the
two
deals
also
had
the
side
benefit
of
increasing
local
news
programming

the
programming
format

by

the

bskyb
believed
that
sports
and
specifically
professional
football
would
be
the
engine
that
would
make
fox
a
major
network
the
quickest
in
1987
after
abc
initially
hedged
on
renewing
its
contract
to
broadcast
monday
night
football
fox
made
an
offer
to
the
national
football
league
nfl
to
acquire
the
rights
for
the
same
amount
that
abc
had
been
paying
about
13
million
per
game
at
the
time
however
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
fox
had
not
yet
established
itself
as
a
major
network
the
nfl
chose
to
renew
its
contract
with
abc
where
monday

football
remained
until
its
move
to
sister

channel
espn
in
september
2006
six
years
later
when
the

entered
contract
negotiations
with

partners
fox
placed
a
1

billion
bid
to
obtain
broadcast
rights
to
the
national
football
conference
covering
four
seasons
of
games
beginning
with
the
1994
nfl
season

the
nfl
selected
the
fox
bid
on
december
18
1993
stripping
cbs
of
football
telecasts
for
the
first
time
since
1955
the
event
placed
fox
on
par
with
the
big
three
television
networks
and
ushered
in
an
era
of
growth
for
the
nfl
fox
s
acquisition
of
the
nfl
rights
also
quickly
led
toward
the

reaching
an
affiliation
deal
with
new

to
change
the

of
twelve
of

edit
network
programming
edit
fox
s
programming
schedule
differs
from
the
big
three
networks
in
several
significant
ways
the
network
airs
its
prime
time
programming
for
only
two
hours
on
monday
through
saturday
evenings
and
three
hours
on
sundays
compared
to
the
three
hours
on
monday
through
saturdays
from
8
00
to

p
m
and
four
hours
on
sunday
nights
from
7
00
to
11
00
p
m
eastern
and
pacific
time
programmed
by
the
three
longer
established
networks
abc
cbs
and
nbc
this
scheduling
is
termed
as
common
prime
referring
to
the
programming
of
prime
time
content
across
all
of
the
conventional
broadcast
networks
during
the
early
and
mid
evening
hours
while
the
10
00
p
m
eastern
hour
is
programmed
only
by
the
three
older
networks
fox
has
traditionally
avoided
programming
the
10
00
p
m
hour
choosing
to
cede
the
time
period
to
its
local
affiliates
for
them
to
program
many
of
which
air
local
newscasts
during
that
hour
however
some
exceptions
do
exist
for
select
special
film
presentations
which
by
virtue
of
their
running
time
depending
on
whether
the
film
s
original
length
combined
with
commercial
breaks
that
would
be
included
in
the
television
cut
would
exceed
a
traditional
two
hour
broadcast
timeslot
must
spill
over
into
the
10
00
p
m
hour
and
overruns
from
live
sports
telecasts
scheduled
to
air
during
prime
time
however
the
network
did
regularly
schedule
programming
in
the
10
00
p
m
hour
on
sunday
nights
from
september
1989
to
september
1993
when
that
specific
time
period
was
turned
back
over
to
its
affiliates
124
although
it
never
added
programming
at
that
hour
on
any
other
night
fox
s
original
reason
for
the
reduced
number
of
prime
time
hours
was
to
avoid
fulfilling
fcc
requirements
in
effect
at
the
time
to
be
considered
a
network
125
126
and
to
be
free
of
resulting
regulations
although
these
rules
have
since
been
relaxed
despite
being
a
major
network
in
addition
to
not
carrying
national
morning
and
evening
newscasts
fox
also
does
not
air
any
network
daytime
programming
such
as
soap
operas
game
shows
or
talk
shows
because
of
this
the
network
s
owned
and
operated
stations
and
affiliates
handle
the
responsibility
of
programming
daytime
hours
with
syndicated
or
locally
produced
programming
then
corporate
sister
20th
television
distributes
several
syndicated
daytime
programs
carried
by
many
fox

as
divorce

the

programming
on
monday
through

nights
local
affiliates
either
produce
their
own
programming
or
run
syndicated
programs
during
these
time
periods
because
of
the
erratic
scheduling
of
the
network
s
sports
programming
many
fox
stations
choose
to
run
a
mix
of
syndicated
programming
infomercials
and
especially
movies
to
fill
weekend
afternoon
timeslots
when
a
sports
event
is
not
scheduled
to

in
addition
from
the
network
s
inception
fox
has
produced
two
versions
of
its
program
promotions
for
distribution
to
the
network
s
stations
a
standard
version
incorporating
airtimes
based
on
their
broadcast
in
the
eastern
central
or
pacific
mountain
time
zones
depending
on
the
feed
used
by
the
station
as
those
seen
during
network
commercial
breaks
and
versions
with
clean
end
tags
to
allow
stations
to
include
local
airtime
and
station
information
through
graphical
insertion
and
verbal
continuity
by
station
promotional
announcers
during
the
program
logo

this
practice
which
differs

that
long
used
by

allow

production

outsourced

either
due
to
insufficient

or
studio

for

in
most
cases
as
a
byproduct
of

being
operated
through

affiliate
often
carry
a
lesser
amount
of
news
programming
than
is
possible
with
an
affiliate
with
a

due
to
the
contracting

preference
to
avoid
having

compete
against

during

use
a

structure
using
a

of
the
fox
name
and
the
station
s
channel
number
often
followed
by
the
licensed
call
letters
for

wnyw
in

city
wttg
in

and
waga
tv
in
atlanta
georgia
are
all
branded
as
fox
5
by
the
mid

late
1990s
stations
minimized
their
call
letters
to
be
just
barely
readable
while
still
in
compliance
with
fcc
identification
requirements
this
marked
the
start
of
the
trend
for
other
networks
to
apply
such
naming
schemes
the
branding
scheme
has
varied
in
some
markets
with
some
fox
stations
using
a
city
or
regional
name
within
the
branding
instead
of
the
channel
number
for
example
chicago
owned

operated
station
wfld
branded
as
fox
chicago
from

tv
branded
as
fox
philadelphia
from
1995
to
2003
a
few
of
the
network
s
stations
also
minimized
use
of
the
fox
name
opting
to
use
their
call
letters
or
a
more
generic
branding
wsvn

has
branded
as

in

which
dropped
its

and
kvrr
channel
15
in
fargo
north
dakota
which
dropped
the
generic
fox
branding
it
used
in
part
due
to
its
network
of
repeater
stations
throughout
eastern
north
dakota
in
favor
of

similarly
most
of
the

that
switched
to

of
its
