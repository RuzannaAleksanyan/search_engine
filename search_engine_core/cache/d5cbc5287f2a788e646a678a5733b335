coprolite
also
known
as
a
coprolith
is
fossilized
feces
coprolites
are
classified
as
trace
fossils
as
opposed
to
body
fossils
as
they
give
evidence
for
the
animal
s
behaviour
in
this
case
diet
rather
than
morphology
the
name
is
derived
from
the
greek
words
κόπρος
kopros
meaning
dung
and
λίθος
lithos
meaning
stone
they
were
first
described
by
william
buckland
in
1829
before
this
they
were
known
as
fossil
fir
cones
and
bezoar
stones
they
serve
a
valuable
purpose
in
paleontology
because
they
provide
direct
evidence
of
the
predation
and
diet
of
extinct
organisms
1
coprolites
may
range
in
size
from
a
few
millimetres
to
over
60
centimetres
coprolites
distinct
from
paleofeces
are
fossilized
animal
dung
like
other
fossils
coprolites
have
had
much
of
their
original
composition
replaced
by
mineral
deposits
such
as
silicates
and
calcium
carbonates
paleofeces
on
the
other
hand
retain
much
of
their
original
organic
composition
and
can
be
reconstituted
to
determine
their
original
chemical
properties
though
in
practice
the
term
coprolite
is
also
used
for
ancient
human
fecal
material
in
archaeological
contexts

initial
discovery
edit
british
fossil
hunter
mary
anning
noticed
as
early
as
1824
that
bezoar
stones
were
often
found
in
the
abdominal
region
of
ichthyosaur
skeletons
found
in
the
lias
formation
at
lyme
regis
5
she
also
noted
that
if
such
stones
were
broken
open
they
often
contained
fossilized
fish
bones
and
scales
as
well
as
sometimes
bones
from
smaller
ichthyosaurs
these
observations
by
anning
led
the
geologist
william
buckland
to
propose
in
1829
that
the
stones
were
fossilized
feces
and
name
them
coprolites
buckland
also
suspected
that
the
spiral
markings
on
the
fossils
indicated
that
ichthyosaurs
had
spiral
ridges
in
their
intestines
similar
to
those
of
modern
sharks
and
that
some
of
these
coprolites
were
black
with
ink
from
swallowed
belemnites

research
value
edit
by
examining
coprolites
paleontologists
are
able
to
find
information
about
the
diet
of
the
animal
if
bones
or
other
food
remains
are
present
such
as
whether
it
was
a
herbivore
or
a
carnivore
and
the
taphonomy
of
the
coprolites
although
the
producer
is
rarely
identified
unambiguously
7
especially
with
more
ancient
examples
8
in
some
instances
knowledge
about
the
anatomy
of
animals
digestive
tracts
can
be
helpful
in
assigning
a
coprolite
to
the
animal
that
produced
it
one
example
being
the
finding
that
the
triassic
dinosauriform
silesaurus
may
have
been
an
insectivore
a
suggestion
which
was
based
on
the
beak
like
jaws
of
the
animal
and
the
high
density
of
beetle
remains
found
in
associated
coprolites
9
further
coprolites
can
be
analyzed
for
certain
minerals
that
are
known
to
exist
in
trace
amounts
in
certain
species
of
plant
that
can
still
be
detected
millions
of
years
later
10
in
rare
cases
coprolites
have
even
been
found
to
contain
well
preserved
insect
remains
11
recognizing
coprolites
edit
the
recognition
of
coprolites
is
aided
by
their
structural
patterns
such
as
spiral
or
annular
markings
content
undigested
food
fragments
and
associated
fossil
remains
the
smallest
coprolites
are
often
difficult
to
distinguish
from
inorganic
pellets
or
from
eggs
most
coprolites
are
composed
chiefly
of
calcium
phosphate
along
with
minor
quantities
of
organic
matter
by
analyzing
coprolites
it
is
possible
to
infer
the
diet
of
the
animal
which
produced
them
coprolites
have
been
recorded
in
deposits
ranging
in
age
from
the
cambrian
period
12
to
recent
times
and
are
found
worldwide
some
of
them
are
useful
as
index
fossils
such
as
favreina
from
the
jurassic
period
of
haute
savoie
in
france
some
marine
deposits
contain
a
high
proportion
of
fecal
remains
however
animal
excrement
is
easily
fragmented
and
destroyed
so
usually
has
little
chance
of
becoming
fossilized
coprolite
mining
edit
in
1842
the
rev
john
stevens
henslow
a
professor
of
botany
at
st
john
s
college
cambridge
discovered
coprolites
just
outside
felixstowe
in
suffolk
in
the
villages
of
trimley
st
martin
13
falkenham
and
kirton
14
and
investigated
their
composition
realising
their
potential
as
a
source
of
available
phosphate
once
they
had
been
treated
with
sulphuric
acid
he
patented
an
extraction
process
and
set
about
finding
new
sources
15
very
soon
coprolites
were
being
mined
on
an
industrial
scale
for
use
as
fertiliser
due
to
their
high
phosphate
content
the
major
area
of
extraction
occurred
over
the
east
of
england
centred
on
cambridgeshire
and
the
isle
of
ely
16
17
with
its
refining
being
carried
out
in
ipswich
by
the
fison
company
17
there
is
a
coprolite
street
near
ipswich
docks
where
the
fisons
works
once
stood
18
the
industry
declined
in
the
1880s
17
13
but
was
revived
briefly
during
the
first
world
war
to
provide
phosphates
for
munitions
16
a
renewed
interest
in
coprolite
mining
in
the
first
world
war
extended
the
area
of
interest
into
parts
of
buckinghamshire
as
far
west
as
woburn
sands
