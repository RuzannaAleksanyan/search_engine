architecturethe
term
norman
architecture
is
used
to
categorise
styles
of
romanesque
architecture
developed
by
the
normans
in
the
various
lands
under
their
dominion
or
influence
in
the
11th
and
12th
centuries
in
particular
the
term
is
traditionally
used
for
english
romanesque
architecture
the
normans
introduced
large
numbers
of
castles
and
fortifications
including
norman
keeps
and
at
the
same
time
monasteries
abbeys
churches
and
cathedrals
in
a
style
characterised
by
the
usual
romanesque
rounded
arches
particularly
over
windows
and
doorways
and
especially
massive
proportions
compared
to
other
regional
variations
of
the
style
origins
edit
these
romanesque
styles
originated
in
normandy
and
became
widespread
in
northwestern
europe
particularly
in
england
which
contributed
considerable
development
and
where
the
largest
number
of
examples
survived
at
about
the
same
time
a
norman
dynasty
that
ruled
in
sicily
produced
a
distinctive
variation
incorporating
byzantine
and
saracen
influences
also
known
as
norman
architecture
or
alternatively
sicilian
romanesque
1
the
term
norman
may
have
originated
with
eighteenth
century
antiquarians
but
its
usage
in
a
sequence
of
styles
has
been
attributed
to
thomas
rickman
in
his
1817
work
an
attempt
to
discriminate
the
styles
of
english
architecture
from
the
conquest
to
the
reformation
in
this
work
he
used
the
labels
norman
early
english
decorated
and
perpendicular
the
more
inclusive
term
romanesque
was
used
of
the
romance
languages
in
english
by
1715
2
and
was
applied
to
architecture
of
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
from
1819
3
although
edward
the
confessor
built
the
original
westminster
abbey
in
romanesque
style
now
all
replaced
by
later
rebuildings
its
construction
predates
the
norman
conquest
it
is
still
believed
to
have
been
the
earliest
major
romanesque
building
in
england
no
other
significant
remaining
romanesque
architecture
in
britain
can
clearly
be
shown
to
predate
the
norman
conquest
however
historians
believe
that
many
surviving
norman
elements
in
buildings
nearly
all
churches
may
well
in
fact
be
anglo
saxon
elements
norman
arch
edit
the
norman
arch
is
a
defining
point
of
norman
architecture
grand
archways
are
designed
to
evoke
feelings
of
awe
and
are
very
commonly
seen
as
the
entrance
to
large
religious
buildings
such
as
cathedrals
norman
arches
are
semicircular
in
form
early
examples
have
plain
square
edges
later
ones
are
often
enriched
with
the
zig
zag
and
roll
mouldings
the
arches
are
supported
on
massive
columns
generally
plain
and
cylindrical
sometimes
with
spiral
decoration
occasionally
square
section
piers
are
found
main
doorways
have
a
succession
of
receding
semicircular
arches
often
decorated
with
mouldings
typically
of
chevron
or
zig
zag
design
sometimes
there
is
a
tympanum
at
the
back
of
the
head
of
the
arch
which
may
feature
sculpture
representing
a
biblical
scene
norman
windows
are
mostly
small
and
narrow
generally
of
a
single
round
headed
light
but
sometimes
especially
in
a
bell
tower
divided
by
a
shaft
into
two
lights

normandy
edit
viking
invaders
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
seine
in
911
at
a
time
when
franks
were
fighting
on
horseback
and
frankish
lords
were
building
castles
over
the
next
century
the
population
of
the
territory
ceded
to
the
vikings
now
called
normans
adopted
these
customs
as
well
as
christianity
and
the
langue
d
oïl
norman
barons
built
timber
castles
on
earthen
mounds
beginning
the
development
of
motte
and
bailey
castles
and
great
stone
churches
in
the
romanesque
style
of
the
franks
by
950
they
were
building
stone
keeps
the
normans
were
among
the
most
travelled
peoples
of
europe
exposing
them
to
a
wide
variety
of
cultural
influences
which
became
incorporated
in
their
art
and
architecture
they
elaborated
on
the
early
christian
basilica
plan
originally
longitudinal
with
side
aisles
and
an
apse
they
began
to
add
in
towers
as
at
the
church
of
saint
étienne
at
caen
in
1067
this
would
eventually
form
a
model
for
the
larger
english
cathedrals

20
years

in

norman
nobles

edward
the

the

with
mouldings
carved

chevron

termed
zig

the

chancels

however
then
constructed
a
stone
castle
in

enclosed
over
three
acres
within

walls
and
this
could
not
be
burned
down

italy

mezzogiorno

the
normans
began
constructing
castles
their
trademark
architectural
piece
in
italy
from
an
early
date
william
iron

built
one
at
an
unidentified
location
stridula
in
calabria
in
1045
after
the
death
of
robert
guiscard
in
1085
the
mezzogiorno
peninsular
southern
italy
experienced
a
series
of
civil
wars
and
fell
under
the
control
of
increasingly
weaker
princes
revolts
characterised
the
region
until
well
into
the
twelfth
century
and
minor
lords
sought
to
resist
ducal
or
royal
power
from
within
their
own
castles
in
the
molise
the
normans
embarked
on
their
most
extensive
castle
building
programme
and
introduced
the
opus
gallicum
technique
to
italy
their
clever
use
of
the
local
stone
artisans
together
with
the
vast
riches
amassed
from
their
enslaved
population
made
such
tremendous
feats
possible
some
as
majestic
as
those
of
the
ancient
roman
structures
they
tried
to
emulate
besides
the
encastellation
of
the
countryside
the
normans
erected
several
religious
buildings
which
still
survive
they
edified
the
shrine
at
monte
sant
angelo
and
built
a
mausoleum
to
the
hauteville
family
at
venosa
they
also
built
many
new
latin
monasteries
including
the
famous
foundation
of
sant
eufemia
lamezia
10
other
examples
of
great
importance
are
the
portal
of
the
shrine
of
mary
queen
of
anglona
and
the
ambulatory
and
radiating
chapels

sicily
edit
sicily
s
norman
period
lasted
from
c
1061
until
about
1200
the
architecture
was
decorated
in
gilded
mosaics
such
as
that
at
the
cathedral
at
monreale
the
palatine
chapel
in
palermo
built
in
1130
is
perhaps
the
strongest
example
of
this
the
interior
of
the
dome

a
byzantine
feature
is
decorated
in
a
mosaic
depicting
christ
pantocrator
accompanied
by
his

during
sicily
s
later
norman
era
early
gothic
influences
can
be
detected
such
as
those
in
the
cathedral
at
messina
consecrated
in
1197
however
here
the
high
gothic
campanile
is
of
a
later
date
and
should
not
be
confused
with
the
early
gothic
built
during
the
norman
period
which
featured
pointed
arches
and
windows
rather
than
the
flying
buttresses
and
pinnacles
later
to
manifest
themselves
in
the
gothic
era
malta
edit
after
its
norman
conquest
in
1091
malta
saw
the
construction
of
several
norman
pieces
of
architecture
many
have
been
demolished
and
rebuilt
over
the
years
especially
after
the
1693
sicily
earthquake
which
destroyed
many
old
norman
buildings
however
some
fortresses
and
houses
still
exist

vittoriosa
transitional
style
edit
as
master
masons
developed
the
style
and
experimented
with
ways
of
overcoming
the
geometric
difficulties
of
groin
vaulted
ceilings
they
introduced
features
such
as
the
pointed
arch
that
were
later
characterised
as
being
gothic
in
style
architectural
historians
and
scholars
consider
that
a
style
must
be
assessed
as
an
integral
whole
rather
than
an
aggregate
of
features
and
while
some
include
these
developments
within
the
norman
or
romanesque
styles
others
describe
them
as
transitional
or
norman
gothic
transitional
a
few
websites
use
the
term
norman
gothic
but
it
is
unclear
whether
they
refer
to
the
transitional
style
or
to
the
norman
style
as
a
whole

neo

neo
norman
architecture
is
a
type
of
romanesque
revival
architecture
based
on
norman
romanesque
architecture
there
is
sometimes
confusion
especially
in
north
america
between
this
style
and
revivalist
versions
of
vernacular
or
later
architecture
of
normandy
such
as
the
norman
farmhouse
style
popular
for
larger
houses
romanesque
revival
versions
focus
on
the
arch
and
capitals
and
decorated
doorways
there
are
