anderson
is
quoted
is
there
going
to
be
peace
in
the
world
i
m
a
christian
i
believe
eventually
there
will
be
at
the
second
coming
i
think
we
are
moving
into
an
era
of
greater
or
if
not
peace
at
least
of
greater
prosperity
think
about
it
in
the
last
10
to
15
years
there
are
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
in
the
world
who
are
living
in
a
greater
degree
of
individual
responsibility
and
freedom
and
perhaps
dignity
than
there
were
15
years
ago
that
s
true
in
eastern
europe
in
latin
america
even
in
asia
that
great
process
of
history
of
thousands
of
years
of
an
increase
in
a
dignity
of
the
individual
seems
to
have
been
halted
for
a
good
period
of
time
by
the
growth
of
totalitarian
societies
and
those
are
breaking
up
now
certainly
the
totalitarian
instinct
has
not
gone
away
there
are
a
great
many
wars
going
on
and
struggles
by
peoples
but
that
ice
jam
that
blockage
that
was
representative
of
the
domination
of
a
third
of
the
world
by
communism
is
gone
i
think
that
s
reason
for
great
optimism
