was
the
official
secret

of
nazi
germany
and
in
german
occupied
europe
the
force
was
created
by
hermann
göring
in
1933
by
combining
the
various
political
police
agencies
of
prussia
into
one
organisation
on
20
april
1934
oversight
of
the
gestapo
passed
to
the
head
of
the
schutzstaffel
ss
heinrich
himmler
who
was
also
appointed
chief
of
german
police
by
hitler
in
1936
instead
of
being
exclusively
a
prussian
state
agency
the
gestapo
became
a
national
one
as
a
sub
office
of
the
sicherheitspolizei
sipo
security
police
from
27
september
1939
it
was
administered
by
the

main
office

it
became
known
as
amt
dept
4
of
the
rsha
and
was
considered
a
sister
organisation
to
the
sicherheitsdienst
sd
security
service
the
gestapo
committed
widespread
atrocities
during
its
existence
the
power
of
the
gestapo
was
used
to
focus
upon
political
opponents

religious

the

those
arrested
by

were
often
held
without

throughout

throughout
the
occupied

simply

contrary
to
popular
perception
the
gestapo
was
actually
a
relatively
small
organization
with
limited
surveillance
capability
despite
this
the
gestapo
proved
extremely
effective
due
to
the
willingness
of
ordinary
germans
to
report
on
fellow
citizens
during
world
war
ii
the
gestapo
played
a
key
role
in
the
holocaust
after
the
war
ended
the
gestapo
was
declared
a
criminal
organisation
by
the
international
military
tribunal
imt
at
the
nuremberg
trials
and
several
top
gestapo
members
were
sentenced
to
death

was
named

this
gave
göring
command
of
the
largest
police
force
in
germany
soon
afterward
göring
detached
the
political
and
intelligence
sections
from
the
police
and
filled
their
ranks
with
nazis
on
26
april
1933
göring
merged
the
two
units
as
the
geheime
staatspolizei
which
was
abbreviated
by
a
post

clerk
for
a

he
originally
wanted
to
name
it
the
secret

but
the
german

were

the
first
commander
of
the
gestapo
was
rudolf
diels
a
protégé
of
göring
diels
was
appointed
with
the
title
of
chief
of

department
1a
of
the
prussian
secret

diels
was
best
known
as
the
primary
interrogator
of
marinus
van
der

after
the
reichstag
fire
in
late
1933
the
reich
interior
minister
wilhelm
frick
wanted
to
integrate
all
the
police
forces
of
the
german
states
under
his
control
göring
outflanked
him
by
removing
the
prussian
political
and
intelligence
departments
from
the
state
interior
ministry
11
göring
took
over
the
gestapo
in
1934
and
urged
hitler
to
extend
the
agency
s
authority
throughout
germany
this
represented
a
radical
departure
from
german
tradition
which
held
that
law
enforcement
was
mostly
a
land
state
and
local
matter
in
this
he
ran
into
conflict
with
schutzstaffel
ss
chief
heinrich
himmler
who
was
police
chief
of
the
second
most
powerful
german
state
bavaria
frick
did
not
have
the
political
power
to
take
on
göring
by
himself
so
he
allied
with
himmler
with
frick
s
support
himmler
pushed
on
by
his
right
hand
man
reinhard
heydrich
took
over
the
political
police
in
state
after
state
soon
only
prussia
was
left
12
concerned
that
diels
was
not
ruthless
enough
to
effectively
counteract
the
power
of
the
sturmabteilung
sa
göring
handed
over
control
of
the
gestapo
to
himmler
on
20
april
1934
13
also
on
that
date
hitler
appointed
himmler
chief
of
all
german
police
outside
prussia
heydrich
named
chief
of
the
gestapo
by
himmler
on
22
april
1934
also
continued
as
head
of
the
ss
security
service
sicherheitsdienst
sd
14
himmler
and
heydrich
both
immediately
began
installing
their
own
personnel
in
select
positions
several
of
whom
were
directly
from
the
bavarian
political
police
such
as
heinrich
müller
franz
josef
huber
and
josef
meisinger
15
many
of
the
gestapo
employees
in
the
newly
established
offices
were
young
and
highly
educated
in
a
wide
variety
of
academic
fields
and
moreover
represented
a
new
generation
of
national
socialist
adherents
who
were
hard
working
efficient
and
prepared
to
carry
the
nazi
state
forward
through
the
persecution
of
their
political
opponents
16
by
the
spring
of
1934
himmler
s
ss
controlled
the
sd
and
the
gestapo
but
for
him
there
was
still
a
problem
as
technically
the
ss
and
the
gestapo
by
proxy
was
subordinated
to
the
sa
which
was
under
the
command
of
ernst
röhm
17
himmler
wanted
to
free
himself
entirely
from
röhm
whom
he
viewed
as
an
obstacle
18
röhm
s
position
was
menacing
as
more
than
4
5
million
men
fell
under
his
command
once
the
militias
and
veterans
organisations
were
absorbed
by
the
sa
19
a
fact
which
fuelled
röhm
s
aspirations
his
dream
of
fusing
the
sa
and
reichswehr
together
was
undermining
hitler
s
relationships
with
the
leadership
of
germany
s
armed
forces
20
several
nazi
chieftains
among
them
göring
joseph
goebbels
rudolf
hess
and
himmler
began
a
concerted
campaign
to
convince
hitler
to
take
action
against
röhm
21
both
the
sd
and
gestapo
released
information
concerning
an
imminent
putsch
by
the
sa
22
once
persuaded
hitler
acted
by
setting
himmler
s
ss
into
action
who
then
proceeded
to
murder
over
100
of
hitler
s
identified
antagonists
the
gestapo
supplied
the
information
which
implicated
the
sa
and
ultimately
enabled
himmler
and
heydrich
to
emancipate
themselves
entirely
from
the
organisation
23
for
the
gestapo
the
next
two
years
following
the
night
of
the
long
knives
a
term
describing
the
putsch
against
röhm
and
the
sa
were
characterised
by
behind
the
scenes
political
wrangling
over
policing
24
on
17
june
1936
hitler
decreed
the
unification
of
all
police
forces
in
germany
and
named
himmler
as
chief
of
german
police
25
this
action
effectively
merged
the
police
into
the
ss
and
removed
it
from
frick
s
control
himmler
was
nominally
subordinate
to
frick
as
police
chief
but
as
reichsführer
ss
he
answered
only
to
hitler
this
move
also
gave
himmler
operational
control
over
germany
s
entire
detective
force
26
the
gestapo
became
a
national
state
agency
himmler
also
gained
authority
over
all
of
germany
s
uniformed
law
enforcement
agencies
which
were
amalgamated
into
the
new
ordnungspolizei
orpo
order
police
which
became
a
national
agency
under
ss
general
kurt
daluege
25
shortly
thereafter
himmler
created
the
kriminalpolizei
kripo
criminal
police
merging
it
with
the
gestapo
into
the
sicherheitspolizei
sipo
security
police
under
heydrich
s
command
27
heinrich
müller
was
at
that
time
the
gestapo
operations
chief
28
he
answered
to
heydrich
heydrich
answered
only
to
himmler
and
himmler
answered
only
to
hitler
25
the
gestapo
had
the
authority
to
investigate
cases
of
treason
espionage
sabotage
and
criminal
attacks
on
the
nazi
party
and
germany
the
basic
gestapo
law
passed
by
the
government
in
1936
gave
the
gestapo
carte
blanche
to
operate
without
judicial
review
in
effect
putting
it
above
the
law
29
the
gestapo
was
specifically
exempted
from
responsibility
to
administrative
courts
where
citizens
normally
could
sue
the
state
to
conform
to
laws
as
early
as
1935
a
prussian
administrative
court
had
ruled
that
the
gestapo
s
actions
were
not
subject
to
judicial
review
the
ss
officer
werner
best
one
time
head
of
legal
affairs
in
the
gestapo
30
summed
up
this
policy
by
saying
as
long
as
the
police
carries
out
the
will
of
the
leadership
it
is
acting
legally
31
on
27
september
1939
the
security
and
police
agencies
of
nazi
germany
with
the
exception
of
the
order
police
were
consolidated
into
the
reich

main

by

32
the

became

for

36
an
oddity
of

was
that
the

had
to

out

from

throughout

after
germany
conquered
poland
in
the
autumn
of
1939
gestapo
officials
believed
that
they
had
neutralised
polish

activities
however
certain

about

of
german

and

units
to

during

invasion
of

was
similar
to

british

secretly
obtained
through
intercepting
and
decoding
german
police
and
ss
messages
sent
by
radio
telegraphy
39
in
1942
the
gestapo
discovered
a
cache
of
polish
intelligence
documents
in
prague
and
were
surprised
to
see
that
polish
agents
and
informants
had
been
gathering
detailed
military
information
and
smuggling
it
out
to
london
via

in

of
the

represented
a
very
serious
danger
to
germany
as

as
6
june
1944
heinrich
müller
concerned
about
the
leakage
of

to

set
up
a
special
unit
called

jerzy
that
was
meant
to
root
out
the
polish
intelligence
network
in
western
and
southwestern
europe
41
in

there
were
groups
still
loyal
to
the
habsburgs
who
unlike
most
across
the
greater
german
reich
remained
determined
to
resist
the
nazis
these
groups
became
a
special
focus
of
the
gestapo
because
of
their
insurrectionist
goals
the
overthrow
of
the
nazi
regime
the
re
establishment
of
an
independent
austria
under
habsburg
leadership
and
hitler
s
hatred
of
the
habsburg

hitler
vehemently
rejected
the
centuries

originally
performed
by

until

took

46
because
the
gestapo
seemed
omniscient
and
omnipotent
the
atmosphere
of
fear
they
created
led
to
an
overestimation

decision
he
made
on

48
as
a

to
this
action
hitler
decreed

religious

parts
of
germany
where
religious
dissent
existed
upon
the
nazi
seizure
of
power
saw
a
rapid
transformation
a
change
as
noted
by
the
gestapo
in
conservative
towns
such
as
würzburg
where
people
acquiesced
to
the
regime
either
through
accommodation
collaboration
or
simple
compliance
52
increasing
religious
objections
to
nazi
policies
led
the
gestapo
to
carefully
monitor
church
organisations
for
the
most
part
members
of
the
church
did
not
offer
political
resistance
but
simply
wanted
to
ensure
that
organizational
doctrine
remained
intact
53
however
the
nazi
regime
sought
to
suppress
any
source
of
ideology
other
than
its
own
and
set
out
to
muzzle
or
crush
the
churches
in
the
so
called
kirchenkampf
when
church
leaders
clergy
voiced
their
misgiving
about
the
euthanasia
program
and
nazi
racial
policies
hitler
intimated
that
he
considered
them
traitors
to
the

67
however
resistance

and
those
who
were
in

were
stalled
by
the
fear
of

from

fearful
of

the

efforts

amounted

very
little
and

but
following
in
their

were

aristocratic

workers
teachers
and
others
from
nearly
every
walk

71
most
people
quickly
learned
that
open
opposition
was
dangerous
since
gestapo
informants
and
agents
were
widespread
however
a
significant
number
of
them
still
worked
against
the
national
socialist
government
72
in

1935
the

broke
up
and
arrested
members
of
the
markwitz
circle
a
group
of
former
socialists
in
contact
with
otto
strasser
who
sought
hitler
s
downfall
73
from
the
mid
1930s
into
the
early
1940s
various
groups
made
up
of
communists
idealists
working
class
people
and
far
right
conservative
opposition
organisations
covertly
fought
against
hitler
s
government
and
several
of
them
fomented
plots
that
included
hitler
s
assassination
nearly
all
of
them
including
the
römer

robby

solf

schwarze

the

of
the
radical
middle

jungdeutscher

schwarze

were
either
discovered
or
infiltrated
by
the

this
led
to
corresponding

being
sent
to
concentration

and
execution
74
one
of
the
methods
employed
by
the
gestapo
to
contend
with
these
resistance
factions
was
protective
detention
which
facilitated
the
process
in
expediting
dissenters
to
concentration
camps
and
against
which
there
was
no
legal
defence
75
early
efforts
to
resist
the
nazis
with
aid
from
abroad
were
hindered
when
the
opposition
s
peace
feelers
to
the
western
allies
did
not
meet
with
success
this
was
partly
because
of
the
venlo
incident
of
9
november
1939
76
in
which
sd
and
gestapo
agents
posing
as
anti

in
the
netherlands
kidnapped
two
british
secret
intelligence
service
sis
officers
after
having
lured
them
to
a
meeting
to
discuss
peace
terms
this
prompted
winston
churchill
to
ban
any
further
contact
with
the
german
opposition
77
later
the
british
and
americans
did
not
want
to
deal
with
anti
nazis
because
they
were
fearful
that
the
soviet
union
would
believe
they
were
attempting
to
make

back
d
the
german
opposition
was
in
an
unenviable
position
by
the
late
spring
and
early
summer
of
1943
on
one
hand
it
was
next
to
impossible
for
them
to
overthrow
hitler
and
the
party
on
the
other
the
allied
demand
for
an
unconditional
surrender
meant
no
opportunity
for
a
compromise
peace
which
left
the
military
and
conservative
aristocrats
who
opposed
the
regime
no
option
in
their
eyes
other
than
continuing
the
military
struggle
79
despite
the
fear
of
the
gestapo
after
mass
arrests
and
executions
in
the
spring
the
opposition
still
plotted
and
planned
one
of
the
more
famous

known
as

this
assassination
attempt
failed
and
hitler
was
only
slightly
injured
reports
indicate
that
the
gestapo
was
caught
unaware
of
this
plot
as
they
did
not
have
sufficient
protections
in
place
at
the
appropriate
locations
nor
did
they
take
any

cracked
down
ruthlessly
on

in
germany
just
as
they
did
everywhere
else

became
more
difficult
arrests

and

were

terror

become
a

was
already

of

25
the
idea
was
to
fully
identify

integrate
the

most
sipo

joined

there
was

conflict
between

the

were
merged
into

both
the

became
distinct
departments
within

32
although
the

was
officially
disbanded
the
term

was
figuratively
used
to
describe

of

the
original
construct
of
the
sipo
gestapo
and
kripo
cannot
be
fully
comprehended
as
discrete
entities

formed
a

was
wedded
to
each

of

in
germany
where
most
of

107
the
canadian
historian
robert
gellately
wrote
that
most
gestapo
men
were
not
nazis
but
at
the
same
time
were
not
opposed
to
the
nazi
regime
which
they
were
willing
to
serve
in
whatever
task
they
were
called
upon
to
perform
107
over
time
membership
in
the
gestapo
included
ideological
training
particularly
once
werner
best
assumed
a
leading
role
for
training
in
april
1936
employing
biological
metaphors
best
emphasised
a
doctrine
which
encouraged
members
of
the
gestapo
to
view
themselves
as
doctors
to
the
national
body
in
the
struggle
against
pathogens
and
diseases
among
the
implied
sicknesses
were
communists
freemasons
and
the
churches
and
above
and
behind
all
these
stood
the
jews
108
heydrich
thought
along
similar
lines
and
advocated
both
defensive
and
offensive
measures
on
the
part
of
the
gestapo
so
as
to
prevent
any
subversion
or
destruction
of
the
national
socialist
body
109
whether
trained
as
police
originally
or
not
gestapo
agents
themselves
were
shaped
by
their
socio
political
environment
historian
george
c
browder
contends
that
there
was
a
four
part
process
authorisation
bolstering
routinisation
and
dehumanisation
in
effect
which
legitimised
the
psycho
social
atmosphere
conditioning
members
of
the
gestapo
to
radicalised
violence
110
browder
also
describes
a
sandwich
effect
where
from
above
gestapo
agents
were
subjected
to
ideologically
oriented
racism
and
criminal
biological
theories
and
from
below
the
gestapo
was
transformed
by
ss
personnel
who
did
not
have
the
proper
police
training
which
showed
in
their
propensity
for
unrestrained
violence
111
this
admixture
certainly
shaped
the
gestapo
s
public
image
which
they
sought
to
maintain
despite
their
increasing
workload
an
image
which
helped
them
identify
and
eliminate
enemies
of
the
nazi
state
112
population
ratios
methods
and
effectivenesscontrary
to
popular
belief
the
gestapo
was
not
the
all
pervasive
omnipotent
agency
in
german
society
113
in
germany
proper
many
towns
and
cities
had
fewer
than
50
official
gestapo
personnel
for
example
in
1939
stettin
and
frankfurt
am
main
only
had
a
total
of
41
gestapo
men
combined
113
in
düsseldorf
the
local
gestapo
office
of
only
281
men
were
responsible
for
the
entire
lower
rhine
region
which
comprised
4
million
people
114
in
lower
franconia
which
included
würzburg
there
were
only
twenty
two
gestapo
officers
overseeing
840
000
or
more
inhabitants
this
meant
that
the
nazi
secret
police
was
reliant
on
germans
spying
on
each
other
115
these
v
men
as
undercover
gestapo
agents
were
known
were
used
to
infiltrate
social
democratic
party
of
germany
spd
and
communist
opposition
groups
but
this
was
more
the
exception
than
the
rule
116
the
gestapo
office
in
saarbrücken
had
50
full
term
informers
in
1939
116
the
district
office
in
nuremberg
which
had
the
responsibility
for
all
of
northern
bavaria
employed
a
total
of
80
100
full
term
informers
between
1943
and
1945
116
the
majority
of
gestapo
informers
were
not
full
term
employees
working
undercover
but
were
rather
ordinary
citizens
who
chose
to
denounce
other
people
to
the
gestapo
117
according
to
canadian
historian
robert
gellately
s
analysis
of
the
local
offices
established
the
gestapo
was
for
the
most
part
made
up
of
bureaucrats
and
clerical
workers
who
depended
upon
denunciations
by
citizens
for
their
information
gellately
argued
that
it
was
because
of
the
widespread
willingness
of
germans
to
inform
on
each
other
to
the
gestapo
that
germany
between
1933
and
1945
was
a
prime
example
of
panopticism
118
the
gestapo
at
times
was
overwhelmed
with
denunciations
and
most
of
its
time
was
spent
sorting
out
the
credible
from
the
less
credible
denunciations
119
many
of
the
local
offices
were
understaffed
and
overworked
struggling
with
the
paper
load
caused
by
so
many
denunciations
120
gellately
has
also
suggested
that
the
gestapo
was
a
reactive
organisation
constructed
within
german
society
and
whose
functioning
was
structurally
dependent
on
the
continuing
co
operation
of
german
citizens
121
after
1939
when
many
gestapo
personnel
were
called
up
for
war
related
work
such
as
service
with
the
einsatzgruppen
the
level
of
overwork
and
understaffing
at
the
local
offices
increased
120
for
information
about
what
was
happening
in
german
society
the
gestapo
continued
to
be
mostly
dependent
upon
denunciations
122
80
of
all
gestapo
investigations
were
started
in
response
to
information
provided
by
denunciations
by
ordinary
germans
while
10
were
started
in
response
to
information
provided
by
other
branches
of
the
german
government
and
another
10
started
in
response
to
information
that
the
gestapo
itself
unearthed
119
the
information
supplied
by
denunciations
often
led
the
gestapo
in
determining
who
was
arrested
122
the
popular
picture
of
the
gestapo
with
its
spies
everywhere
terrorising
german
society
has
been
rejected
by
many
historians
as
a
myth
invented
after
the
war
as
a
cover
for
german
society
s
widespread
complicity
in
allowing
the
gestapo
to

michael
mallmann
and

which
by
focusing
on
what

offices
were
doing
has
shown
the
gestapo
s
almost
total
dependence
on
denunciations
from
ordinary
germans
and
very
much
discredited
the
older
big

picture
with
the

eyes
and

125
an
examination
of

denunciations
in

showed
that
37
were
motivated
by
personal
conflicts
no

could
be
established

and

were
motivated
by

126
the
gestapo
always
showed
a
special
interest
in
denunciations
concerning
sexual
matters
especially
cases
concerning
rassenschande
with
jews
or
between
germans
and
foreigners
in
particular
polish
slave
workers
the
gestapo
applied
even
harsher
methods
to
the
foreign
workers
in
the
country
especially
those
from
poland
127
jews
catholics
and
homosexuals
128
as
time
went
by
anonymous
denunciations
to
the
gestapo
caused
trouble
to
various
nsdap
officials
who
often
found
themselves
being
investigated
by
the
gestapo
129
of
the
political
cases
61
people
were
investigated
for
suspicion
of
belonging
to
the
kpd
44
for
the
spd
and
69
for
other
political
parties
130
most
of
the
political
investigations
took
place
between
1933
and
1935
with
the
all
time
high
of
57
cases
in
1935
130
after
that
year
political
investigations
declined
with
only
18
investigations
in

in
1939

four
in

and
one
in

130
the
other
category
associated
with
non
conformity
included
everything
from
a
man
who
drew
a
caricature
of
hitler
to
a
catholic
teacher
suspected
of
being
lukewarm
about
teaching
national
socialism
in
his
classroom
130
the
administrative
control
category
concerned
those
who
were
breaking
the
law
concerning
residency
in
the
city
130
the
conventional
criminality
category
concerned
economic
crimes
such
as
money
laundering
smuggling
and
homosexuality
131
normal
methods
of
investigation
included
various
forms
of
blackmail
threats
and
extortion
to
secure
confessions
132
beyond
that
sleep
deprivation
and
various
forms
of
harassment
were
used
as
investigative
methods
132
failing
that
torture
and
planting
evidence
were
common
methods
of
resolving
a
case
especially
if
the
case
concerned
someone
jewish
133
brutality
on
the
part
of
interrogators
often
prompted
by
denunciations
and
followed
with
roundups
enabled
the
gestapo
to
uncover
numerous
resistance
networks
it
also
made
them
seem
like
they
knew
everything
and
could
do
anything
they
wanted
134
while
the
total
number
of
gestapo
officials
was
limited
when
contrasted
against
the
represented
populations
the
average
volksgenosse
nazi
term
for
the
member
of
the
german
people
was
typically
not
under
observation
so
the
statistical
ratio
between
gestapo
officials
and
inhabitants
is
largely
worthless
and
of
little
significance
according
to
some
recent
scholars
135
as
historian
eric
johnson
remarked
the
nazi
terror
was
selective
terror
with
its
focus
upon
political
opponents
ideological
dissenters
clergy
and
religious
organisations
career
criminals
the
sinti
and
roma
population
handicapped
persons
homosexuals
and
above
all
upon
the
jews
4
selective
terror
by
the
gestapo
as
mentioned
by
johnson
is
also
supported
by
historian
richard
evans
who
states
that
violence
and
intimidation
rarely
touched
the
lives
of
most
ordinary
germans
denunciation
was
the
exception
not
the
rule
as
far
as
the
behaviour
of
the
vast
majority
of
germans
was
concerned
136
the
involvement
of
ordinary
germans
in
denunciations
also
needs
to
be
put
into
perspective
so
as
not
to
exonerate
the
gestapo
as
evans
makes
clear
it
was
not
the
ordinary
german
people
who
engaged
in
surveillance
it
was
the
gestapo
nothing
happened
until
the
gestapo
received
a
denunciation
and
it
was
the
gestapo
s
active
pursuit
of
deviance
and
dissent
that
was
the
only
thing
that
gave
denunciations
meaning
137
the
gestapo
s
effectiveness
remained
in
the
ability
to
project
omnipotence
they
co
opted
the
assistance
of
the
german
population
by
using
denunciations
to
their
advantage
proving
in
the
end
a
powerful
ruthless
and
effective
organ
of
terror
under
the
nazi
regime
that
was
seemingly
everywhere
138
lastly
the
gestapo
s
effectiveness
while
aided
by
denunciations
and
the
watchful
eye
of
ordinary
germans
was
more
the
result
of
the
co
ordination
and
co
operation
amid
the
various
police
organs
within
germany
the
assistance
of
the
ss
and
the
support
provided
by
the
various
nazi
party
organisations
all
of
them
together
forming

operations
in

an
instrument
of
nazi
power
terror
and
repression
the
gestapo
operated
throughout
occupied
europe
140
much
like
their
affiliated
organisations
the
ss
and
the
sd
the
gestapo
played
a
leading
part
in
enslaving
and
deporting
workers
from
occupied
territory
torturing
and
executing
civilians
singling
out
and
murdering
jews
and
subjecting
allied
prisoners
of
war
to
terrible
treatment
141
to
this
end
the
gestapo
was
a
vital
component
both
in
nazi
repression
and
the
holocaust
142
once
the
german
armies
advanced
into
enemy
territory
they
were
accompanied
by
einsatzgruppen
staffed
by
officers
from
the
gestapo
and
kripo
who
usually
operated
in
the
rear
areas
to
administer
and
police
the
occupied
land
143
whenever
a
region
came
fully
under
german
military
occupational
jurisdiction
the
gestapo
administered
all
executive
actions
under
the
military
commander
s
authority
albeit
operating
relatively
independent
of
it
143
a
former
partisan
and
soviet
officer
named
hersch
gurewicz
attested
to
the
torture
methods
used
by
the
gestapo
he
recalled
a
partisan
was
strapped
to
a
table
in
a
room
and
a
german
turned
the
lever
and
the
table
moved
apart
in
sections
like
a
rack
the
man
screamed
and
his
leg
bones
snapped
through
his
skin
the
lever
turned
again
and
his
arms
ripped
in
jagged
tears
after
the
man
fainted
his
torturers
shot
him
dead
144
he
also
claimed
that
he
had
been
strapped
down
and
a
wire
slowly
forced
up
his
nose
into
his
lung
causing
him
to
go
unconscious
later
he
was
tied
to
a
horse
which
was
made
to
gallop
full
speed
and
recalled
being
smashed
into
the
ground
repeatedly
before
being
knocked
out
by
a
solid
object
145
occupation
meant
administration
and
policing
a
duty
assigned
to
the
ss
the
sd
and
the
gestapo
even
before
hostilities
began
as
was
the
case
for
czechoslovakia
146
correspondingly
gestapo
offices
were
established
in
a
territory
once
occupied
104
e
some
locals
aided
the
gestapo
whether
as
professional
police
auxiliaries
or
in
other
duties
nonetheless
operations
performed
either
by
german
members
of
the
gestapo
or
auxiliaries
from
willing
collaborators
of
other
nationalities
were
inconsistent
in
both
disposition
and
effectiveness
varying
degrees
of
pacification
and
police
enforcement
measures
were
necessary
in
each
place
dependent
on
how
cooperative
or
resistant
the
locals
were
to
nazi
mandates
and
racial
policies
147
throughout
the
eastern
territories
the
gestapo
and
other
nazi
organisations
co
opted

of
indigenous
police
units
nearly
all
of
whom
were
uniformed
and
able
to
carry
out

actions

of
the

operating
on

the

were

included

by

and
latvians
149
while
in
many
countries
the
nazis
occupied

the
east
the
local
domestic
police
forces
supplemented
german
operations
noted
holocaust
historian
raul
hilberg
asserts
that
those
of
poland
were
least
involved
in
anti
jewish
actions
148
nonetheless
german
authorities
ordered
the
mobilisation
of
reserve
polish
police
forces
known
as
the
blue
police
which
strengthened
the
nazi
police
presence
and
carried
out
numerous
police
functions
in
some
cases
its
functionaries
even
identified
and
rounded
up
jews
or
performed
other
unsavory
duties
on
behalf
of
their
german
masters
150
in
places
like
denmark
there
were
some
550
uniformed
danes
in
copenhagen
working
with
the
gestapo
patrolling
and
terrorising
the
local
population
at
the
behest
of
their
german
overseers
many
of
whom
were
arrested
after
the
war
151
other
danish
civilians
like
in
many
places
across
europe
acted
as
gestapo
informants
but
this
should
not
be
seen
as
wholehearted
support
for
the
nazi
program
as
motives
for
cooperation
varied
152
whereas
in
france
the
number
of
members
in
the
carlingue
french
gestapo
who
worked
on

of
the
nazis
was
upwards
of
30
000
to
