the
legend
of

is

high
regard
by
the
development
team
and
is
cited
as
one
of
the
main
inspirations
for
genshin
impact
66
development
was
aimed
at
making
the
game
different
and
fun
from
other
mmorpgs
in
terms
of
its
quest
and
combat
systems
as
well
as
its
random
events
and
mode
of
exploration
67
the
game
was
designed
to
be
cross
platform
as
developing
the
game
for
pc
and
console
allowed
the
developers
to
raise
graphical
fidelity
for
the
game
such
as
rendering
realistic
shadows
66
the
overall
artistic
vision
of
the
game
was
intended
to
combine
an
anime
style
with
more
key
elements
from
real
world
cultures
68
and
each
nation
is
based
on
a
region
of
the
world
the
game
s
primary
mythological
basis
is
gnosticism
particularly
the
way
it
understands
relationships
between
humans
and
their
world
and
how
gods
may
influence
this
relationship
77
the
name
given
to
teyvat
s
gods
archon
is
inspired
by
the
related
deities
from
the
gnostic
tradition
although
each
archon
has
a
personal
name
for
their
vessel
or
human
form
and
is
referred
to
with
a
specific
title
by
the
citizens
of
their
nation
most
gods
in
the
game
s
story
even
those
who
are
not
archons
take
the
names
of
demons
from
the
ars
goetia
the
first
volume
of
the
lesser
key
of
solomon
78
musicthe
music
team
headed
by
yu
peng
chen
from
hoyo

composed
the
game
s
original
score
which
was
performed
by
the
london
philharmonic
orchestra
the
shanghai
symphony
orchestra
and
the
tokyo
philharmonic
orchestra
79
80
81
the
approach
to
creating
the
soundtrack
is
to
immerse
players
within
the
game
and
provide
emotional
and
beautiful
melodies
82
based
upon
a
foundation
of
western
music
the
score
also
has
regional
and
cultural
influences
added
depending
upon
the
region
83
for
example
in
mondstadt
chen
used
woodwind
instruments
to
reflect
mondstadt
s
association
with
wind
and
freedom
82
in
contrast
the
battle
themes
use
polyphony
and
other
composing
techniques
as
well
as
mimicking
orchestration
elements
from
composers
such
as
beethoven
82
several
soundtrack

lauded
the

as
revolutionary
for
the

imagine
a
mobile

with

with

polygon
also
praised
the
game
for
differentiating
itself
from
its
peers
heralding
its
arrival
as
mobile
games
become
more
mainstream
and
appealing
to
an
audience
outside
the
typical
mobile

demographic
and
new

without
the

133
conversely
genshin

has
been
criticized
for
its
endgame
content
its
gacha
monetization
system
and
its
self
limitations
ari
nortis
of
kotaku
for
instance
wrote
that
although
the
game
provides
a
solid
experience
it
also
has
some
of
the
typical
bullshit
that
comes
along
with
a
zero
dollar
price
tag
and
that
the
gacha
system
can
lead
to
a
cycle
that
belongs
more
in
reno
nevada
than
a
magical
fantasy
land
of
gods
and
wizards
134

echoed
this
criticism
noting
that
the
game
is
hampered
a
bit
by

its

that

about
how

the

the

that
