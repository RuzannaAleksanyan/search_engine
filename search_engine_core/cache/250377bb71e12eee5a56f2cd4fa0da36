coyle
said
into
temptation
was
partially
inspired
by
his
father
james
patrick
coyle
a
kind
but
belligerent
man
who
had
been
encouraged
by
his
mother
to
become
a
priest

coyle
conceived
of
the
script
for
into

while
imagining
what
kind
of
priest
his
father
would
have
been

10
his
father
strongly
approved
of
the
project
and
told
coyle
go
make
that
movie
and
tell
the
truth
7
coyle
was
also
partially
inspired
by
his
childhood
pastor
and
friend
the
reverend
damian
zuerlein
who
performed
the
marriage
ceremony
for
coyle
and
his
wife
and
baptized
their
children
coyle
said
of
him
he
s
just
a
young
energetic
competent
committed
devoted
man
working
with
a
poor
parish
and
he
loves
his
work
i
was
inspired
by
that
2
coyle
said
when
writing
into
temptation
he
did
not
intend
to
make
a
religious
film
and
said
of
protagonist
father
john
buerlein
the
character
could
have
been
a
minister
or
a
rabbi
or
a
public
defender
he
s
a
good
man
trying
to
do
a
job

best
he

the

s
producer
helped
with
the
script
from
the
earliest
stages
and
claimed
she
and
coyle
had
a
deep
understanding
of
how
to
handle
the
characters
from
the
start

the
film
was
set
in
minneapolis
minnesota
where
coyle
lived

actor
at
the
time
the
fictional
church
in

based
in
part
on
the
st
mary
magdalene
church
in
omaha
nebraska
where
coyle
was
raised
however
the
real
life
church
was
also
very
different
from
the
fictional
church
in
that
it
lacked
a
shelter
and
drew
very
large
congregations
for
weekend
mass
compared
to
the
half
empty
pews
in
the
fictional
church
the

just
come
off

felt
this
respite
from
the
task
of
trying
to
force
a
space
where
i
could
express
something
more
personal
through
my

than
a

themesthroughout
the
film
father
john
is
warned
that
his
role
as
a
priest
comes
with
boundaries
and
that
he
should
not
become
personally
involved
with
the
congregants
or
try
to
solve
their
problems
except
through
counseling
1

however
father
john
begins
to
question
those
boundaries
and
reconsider
whether
the
role
as
priest
goes
far
enough
in
having
a
positive
substantive
impact
on
the
lives
of
those
in
his
care
particularly
linda

32
and
in
addition
to
questioning
whether
he
is
helping
his
congregants
father
john
questions
whether
staying
within
those
boundaries
is
enough
to
personally
fulfill
himself
as
a
priest
and
provide
his
own
life
with
meaning
he
ultimately
crosses
over
those
boundaries
and
gets
personally
involved
in

help

delving
into

the
film
takes
a
modern
liberal
approach
to
the
rules
and
constraints
of
catholicism
even
before
father
john
decides
to
help
linda
he
is
questioning
the
constraints
of
his

and
calling

while
speaking
to
a
prospective
mother
struggling
over
whether
to
raise
her
daughter
within
the
strict
confines
of
catholicism
father
john
gives
her
advice
beyond
the
official
dogma
and
encourages
her
to
be
flexible
telling
her
she
should
take
what
works
from
the
church
teachings
14
father
john
also
has
an
unorthodox
view
of
homosexuality
compared
to
the
normal
views
of
the
church
this
is
demonstrated
in
a
scene
in
which
the
priest
comforts
a
young
man
who
is
struggling
with
his
homosexual
feelings
19
in
meeting
and
interacting
with
the
pimps
and
prostitutes
of
the
red
light
district
into
temptation
blurs
the
lines
between
good
and
evil
and
between
right
and
wrong
1
the
negative
responses
father
john
encounters
from
congregants
and
the
church
regarding
his
trips
to
the
red
light
district
demonstrate
the
way
sex
and
poverty
are
often
stigmatized
in
society
19
as
the
title
suggests
one
of
the
major
themes
of
the
film
involves
the
temptations
father
john
faces
to
sin
and
stray
from
his
priestly
calling
1
10
this
is
perhaps
most
strongly
manifested
in
his
apparent
ambivalence
regarding
the
vow
of
celibacy
required
of
catholic
priests
as
father
john
goes
deeper
into
the
red
light
district
and
the
seedier
aspects
of
minneapolis
he
appears
to
face
temptations
from
the
prostitution
and
overt
sexuality
surrounding
him
additionally
it
can
be
interpreted
that
his
interest
in
linda
is
one
of
physical
attraction
as
well
as
a
desire
to
help
her
16
27
this
is
further
manifested
through
the
sudden
reappearance
of
his
former
girlfriend
for
whom
father
john
admits
to
still
harboring
romantic
feelings
the
priest
demonstrates
conflicting
emotions
when
it
comes
to
maintaining
his
priestly
vows
and
his
relationship
with
nadine
1
14
27
into
temptation
is
also
a
story
of
redemption
both
for
linda
who
is
seeking
redemption
for
a
life
of
sin
and
prostitution
and
for
father
john
who
is
seeking
redemption
for
his
failure
to
help
linda
and
his
own
doubts
about
religion
and
priesthood
1

18
at
the
start
of
the
film
father
john
appears
to
be
questioning
his
duty
to
the
church
and
its
dwindling
congregation
this
is
especially
demonstrated
when
he
appears
bored
during
confession
and
does
crossword
puzzles
to
pass
the
time
1
14
such
struggles
are
not
uncommon
in
priesthood
9
but
after
he
resists
the
church
boundaries
and
attempts
to
help
linda
his
faith
in
the
congregation
and
belief
in
the
profession
are
restored
and
he
returns
to
the
church
a
stronger
and
more
content
priest
32
the
film
demonstrates
the
power
of
compassion
and
individual
kindness
particularly
in
the
way
that
john
s
simple
act
of
defending
linda
during
her
childhood
was
such
a
profound
moment
in
her
life
9
18
the
film
also
advocates
repentance
and
the
extent
of
linda
s
victimization
can
be
interpreted
as
a
sign
of
how
catastrophic
an
unrepentant
life
can
be
