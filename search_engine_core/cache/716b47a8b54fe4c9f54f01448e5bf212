the
treaty
of
london
italian
trattato
di
londra
or
the
pact
of
london
patto
di
londra
was
a
secret
agreement
concluded
on
26
april
1915
by
the
united
kingdom
france
and
russia
on
the
one
part
and
italy
on
the
other
in
order
to
entice
the
latter
to
enter
world
war
i
on
the
side
of
the
triple
entente
the
agreement
involved
promises
of
italian
territorial
expansion
against
austria
hungary
the
ottoman
empire
and
in
africa
where
it
was
promised
enlargement
of
its
colonies
the
entente
countries
hoped
to
force
the
central
powers
particularly
germany
and
austria
hungary
to
divert
some
of
their
forces
away
from
existing
battlefields
the
entente
also
hoped
that
romania
and
bulgaria
would
be
encouraged
to
join
them
after
italy
did
the
same
in
may
1915
italy
declared
war
on
austria
hungary
but
waited
a
year
before
declaring
war
on
germany
leading
france
and
the
uk
to
resent
the
delay
at
the
paris
peace
conference
after
the
war
the
united
states
of
america
applied
pressure
to
void
the
treaty
as
contrary
to
the
principle
of
self
determination
a
new
agreement
produced
at
the
conference
reduced
the
territorial
gains
promised
by
the
treaty
italy
received
trentino
and
the
julian
march
in
addition
to
occupation
of
the
city
of
vlorë
and
the
dodecanese
islands
italy
was
compelled
to
settle
its
eastern
border
with
the
new
kingdom
of
serbs
croats
and
slovenes
through
the
bilateral
treaty
of
rapallo
italy
thus
received
istria
and
the
city
of
zadar
as
an
enclave
in
dalmatia
along
with
several
islands
along
the
eastern
adriatic
sea
shore
the
entente
went
back
on
its
promises
to
provide
italy
with
expanded
colonies
and
a
part
of
asia
minor
the
results
of
the
paris
peace
conference
transformed
wartime
national
fervour
in
italy
into
nationalistic
resentment
championed
by
gabriele
d
annunzio
by
declaring
that
the
outcome
of
italy
s
war
was
a
mutilated
victory
he
led
a
successful
march
of
veterans
and
disgruntled
soldiers
to
capture
the
port
of
rijeka
claimed
by
italy
and
denied
by
the
entente
powers
the
move
became
known
as
the
impresa
di
fiume
and
d
annunzio
proclaimed
the
short
lived
italian
regency
of
carnaro
in
the
city
before
being
forced
out
by
the
italian
military
so
that
the
free
state
of
fiume
could
be
established
instead
the
regency
of
carnaro
was

edit
soon
after

war
i
the
triple
entente
powers
the
united

sought
to
attract
more

side
the
first

to
bring
in
italy
a
part
of
the
triple
alliance
as
an
ally
of
the
entente
was
in
august

the
matter
became
closely
related
to
contemporary
efforts
to
obtain
an
alliance
with
bulgaria

at

secure
its
neutrality

in
return
for

the

1914
negotiations
between
the
entente
and
italy
were
conducted
on
russian
initiative
on
4
august
only
a
day
after
italy
declared
neutrality
it
its
ambassador
to
russia
said
that
italy
might
join
the
entente
in
return
for
trentino
vlorë
and
a
dominant
position
in
the
adriatic
believing
that
such
a
move
by
italy
would
prompt
romania
to
join
the
entente
as
well
against
austria
hungary
russian
foreign
minister
sergey
sazonov
pursued
the
matter
british
foreign
minister
edward
grey
supported
the
idea
he
said
that
trieste
should
be
added
to
the
claim
as
potentially
important
to
win
over
italian
public
opinion
on
joining
the
war
1
the
italian
ambassador
to
the
united
kingdom
guglielmo
imperiali
presented
grey
with
italy
s
conditions
but
grey
did
not
consider
the
talks
could
produce
any
practical
results
he
told
imperiali
that
britain
would
not
consider
the
matter
any
further
until
italy
committed
itself
to
joining
the
entente
on
grey
s
instructions
rennell
rodd
british
ambassador
to
italy
asked
italian
prime
minister
antonio
salandra
if
italy
could
enter
the
war
salandra
informed
rodd
that
this
was
impossible
at
the
time
and
that
any
premature
attempt
to
abandon
neutrality
would
jeopardise
any
prospect
of
a
future
alliance
sazonov
was
informed
accordingly
and
russia
abandoned
the
matter
4
the
motives
for
the
entente
s
overture
to
italy
and
italian
consideration
of
entering
the
war
were
entirely
opportunistic
the
entente
saw
germany
as
the
principal
enemy
and
wanted
to
force
it
to
divert
some
of
its
forces
away
from
the
existing
battlefields
italy
had
basically
different
interests
from
the
entente
powers
it
saw
opportunities
to
fulfil
italian
irredentist
objectives
in
austria
hungary
to
gain
a
dominant
position
in
the
adriatic
basin
and
to
expand
its
colonial
empire
5
initially
the
majority
of
the
italian
public
favoured
neutrality
but
groups
favouring
an
expansionist
war
against
austria
hungary
formed
in
every
part
of
the
political
spectrum
the
most
ardent
supporters
of
war
became
irredentist
groups
such
as
trento
e
trieste
trento
and
trieste
led
by
giovanni
giuriati
or
alfredo
rocco
who
saw
the
war
as
an
opportunity
for
ethnic
struggle
against
neighbouring
south
slavic
populations
6
occupation
of
vlorë
edit
salandra
and
his
foreign
minister
antonino
paternò
castello
did
not
break
off
the
negotiations
completely
they
used
the
subsequent
months
to
wait
for
a
chance
to
increase
italian
demands
to
the
maximum
at
an
opportune
time
there
was
an
attempt
to
relaunch
the
negotiations
in
london
on
16
september
when
castello
told
rodd
that
british
and
italian
shared
interests
in
preventing
westward
spread
of
slavic
domains
under
russian
influence
specifically
by
preventing
slavic
influence
in
the
adriatic
where
irredentists
claimed
dalmatia
while
castello
instructed
imperiali
to
tell
the
british
that
italy
would
not
decide
to
abandon
its
neutrality
before
the
entente
accepted
their
conditions
grey
insisted
on
italy
first
committing
to
joining
the
entente
and
the
talks
collapsed
again
7
particular
opposition
to
the
italian
claim
against
dalmatia
came
from
the
permanent
under
secretary
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
arthur
nicolson
who
remarked
that
sazonov
was
right
to
claim
that
dalmatia
wished
to
unite
with
kingdom
of
croatia
slavonia
he
added
that
if
dalmatia
were
annexed
by
italy
it
would
inherit
a
problem
from
austria
hungary
that
of
having
a
large
south
slavic
population
looking
for
greater
independence
8
nonetheless
castello
managed
to
obtain
british
endorsement
for
italian
occupation
of
vlorë
the
move
was
made
as
a
preparation
for
italian
intervention
and
designed
to
lend
some
prestige
to
the
italian
government
expecting
opposition
from
sazonov
castello
asked
grey
to
get
the
russians
to
let
him
have
this
without
making
any
concessions
in
return
as
a
necessary
evil
to
attract
italy
to
join
the
entente

sonnino
replaces
castello
edit
in
late
october
there
was
an
attempt
to
get
italy
to
intervene
against
an
expected
turkish
attack
against
the
suez
canal
sazonov
warned
grey
not
to
offer
dalmatia
in
exchange
and
the
latter
replied
that
no
such
offer
was
made
as
the
canal
remaining
open
was
in
italian
interests
too
10
the
matter
of
an
italian
alliance
was
taken
up
by
castello
s
successor
sidney
sonnino
and
rodd
in
november
sonnino
proposed
a
non
binding
agreement
which
could
be
turned
into
a
binding
one
at
an
opportune
time
even
though
similar
proposals
by
his
predecessor
were
turned
down
rodd
was
informed
through
his
contacts
in
the
italian
government
that
the
italian
armed
forces
were
prepared
to
intervene
by
february
1915
prompting
rodd
to
urge
grey
to
consider
the
proposal
however
grey
declined
the
idea
as
a
hypothetical
bargain
as
he
appeared
indifferent
to
an
italian
alliance
at
this
point
11
following
this
salandra
and
sonnino
conducted
negotiations
with
the
central
powers
in
an
apparent
attempt
to
keep
the
central
powers
at
bay
until
further
negotiations
were
possible
with
the
entente
these
talks
collapsed
on
15
february
1915
the
following
day
sonnino
sent
imperiali
a
specific
list
of
conditions
set
out
in
sixteen
points
necessary
for
italy
to
enter
the
war
12
13
seeking
bulgarian
alliance
edit
while
the
entente
powers
were
negotiating
with
italy
they
led
a
concurrent
diplomatic
effort
aimed
at
obtaining
bulgarian
alliance
or
at
least
friendly
neutrality
this
situation
led
to
a
conflict
of
territorial
claims
staked
by
italy
and
serbia
namely
awarding
italy
dalmatia
would
largely
block
the
adriatic
outlet
offered
to
serbia
in
addition
to
bosnia
and
herzegovina
as
compensation
to
serbia
s
cession
of
much
of
vardar
macedonia
to
bulgaria
requested
by
the
entente
as
enticement
to
bulgaria
sazonov
wanted
to
strengthen
his
offer
to
serbia
and
indirectly
to
bulgaria
by
guaranteeing
such
an
outlet
to
serbia
but
grey
blocked
the
initiative
arguing
that
an
italian
alliance
was
more
important
14
in
mid
february
following
the
start
of
the
gallipoli
campaign
the
british
were
convinced
that
bulgaria
would
enter
the
war
on
the
side
of
the
entente
within
weeks
certain
of
its
victory
even
though
it
worked
to
bring
bulgaria
on
board
russia
was
anxious
that
bulgarian
and
greek
forces
might
occupy
constantinople
to
push
russia
out
of
the
region
despite
being
promised
control
of
the
city
by
the
entente
15
sonnino
saw
the
combined
bulgarian
and
greek
entry
into
the
war
likely
to
assure
entente
victory
in
the
balkans
on
4
march
imperiali
informed
grey
that
italy
would
enter
the
war
and
presented
him
with
the
16
conditions
insisting
on
curtailing
slavic
westward
advance
16
russian
claim
over
constantinople
edit
grey
noted
that
the
italian
claims
were
excessive
but
also
that
they
did
not
conflict
with
british
interests
he
also
thought
that
recent
russian
stubborn
objections
against
greek
attack
to
capture
constantinople
could
be
overcome
by
addition
of
italian
troops
and
that
italian
participation
in
the
war
would
expedite
a
decision
from
bulgaria
and
romania
still
waiting
to
commit
to
the
war
16
sazonov
objected
to
any
italian
role
regarding
constantinople
seeing
it
as
a
threat
to
russian
control
of
the
city
promised
by
the
allies
in
return
for
russian
losses
in
the
war
16
this
led
grey
to
obtain
formal
recognition
of
the
russian
claim
to
the
city
by
the
committee
of
imperial
defence
and
by
france
leading
sazonov
to
acquiesce
to
an
agreement
with
italy
except
he
would
not
consent
to
italy
taking
the
adriatic
coast
south
of
the
city
of
split
and
as
long
as
the
italian
troops
did
not
participate
in
the
capture
of
the
turkish
straits
17
the
request
concerning
the
turkish
straits
was
found
acceptable
by
grey
since
the
british
never
anticipated
italy
would
take
part
in
the
campaign
against
constantinople
the
bulk
of
the
italian
claim
concerning
acquisition
of
trentino
trieste
and
istria
was
likely
to
attract
protests
against
handing
predominantly
slav
populated
territories
to
italy
from
frano
supilo
a
dominant
figure
in
the
nascent
yugoslav
committee
advocating
interests
of
south
slavs
living
in
austria
hungary
on
the
other
hand
the
serbian
prime
minister
nikola
pašić
and
sazonov
found
it
acceptable
17
even
though
serbian
niš
declaration
of
war
objectives
called
for
the
struggle
to
liberate
and
unify
unliberated
brothers
18
referring
to
three
tribes
of
one
people
meaning
the
serbs
the
croats
and
the
slovenes
as
means
to
attract
support
from
south
slavs
living
in
austria
hungary
19
pašić
was
primarily
concerned
with
achieving
a
greater
serbia
sazonov
acquiesced
17
adding
that
he
has
nothing
to
say
on
behalf
of
the
croats
and
the
slovenes
and
would
not
approve
russian
forces
to
fight
half
a

for
liberty
of
the
slovenes
20
final
six
weeks
of
talks
edit
nonetheless
negotiations
extended
for
six
weeks
over
disagreements
as
the
extent
of
italian
territorial
gains
in
dalmatia
was
still
objected
to
by
sazonov
the
italian
claim
of
dalmatia
to
the
neretva
river
including
the
pelješac
peninsula
and
all
adriatic
islands
was
not
based
on
self
determination
but
on
security
concerns
in
a
future
war
as
the
italian
negotiators
alleged
that
russia
might
occupy
the
austrian
controlled
coast
while
italy
had
no
defensible
port
on
the
western
shore
of
the
adriatic
the
committee
of
imperial
defence
was
concerned
about
rising
russian
naval
power
in
the
mediterranean
and
it
is
possible
although
there
is
no
direct
evidence
that
this
influenced
the
british
support
for
the
italian
claims
in
the
adriatic
as
means
to
deny
it
to
russia
21
hoping
to
achieve
the
diplomatic
breakthrough
in
securing
alliances
with
bulgaria
romania
and
greece
grey
turned
sonnino
s
16
points
into
a
draft
agreement
and
forwarded
it
to
russia
against
protests
by
the
yugoslav
committee
sazonov
objected
to
the
draft
agreement
and
dismissed
an
italian
offer
of
dubrovnik
as
a
port
for
south
slavs
as
it
lacked
inland
transport
routes
sazonov
demanded
split
in
addition
as
a
better
port
and
objected
to
the
requested
demilitarisation
of
the
coast
belonging
to
the
kingdom
of
montenegro
grey
drew
up
a
document
taking
into
consideration
the
russian
objections
and
forwarded
it
to
imperiali
but
sonnino
threatened
to
end
the
negotiations
over
the
differences
22
the
deadlock
was
broken
by
french
foreign
minister
théophile
delcassé
who
was
ready
to
pay
any
price
to
obtain
an
alliance
with
italy
believing
it
would
bring
about
alliances
with
bulgaria
greece
and
romania
as
well
delcassé
proposed
a
reduction
in
the
italian
claim
in
dalmatia
to
favour
serbia
in
exchange
for
unrestricted
possession
of
the
dodecanese
islands
the
initiative
succeeded
because
the
russian
imperial
army
lost
initiative
in
the
carpathians
and
its
commander
in
chief
grand
duke
nicholas
informed
sazonov
that
italian
and
romanian
support
would
be
needed
urgently
to
regain
the
initiative
in
response
sazonov
accepted
the
proposal
put
forward

delcassé
insisting
that

enter
