of
tornadoes
causing
100
or
more
deaths
this
is
a
list
of
the
deadliest
tornadoes
in
world
history
this
list
includes
confirmed
individual
tornadoes
that
caused
100
or
more
direct
fatalities
the
deadliest
tornadoes
by
far
have
occurred
in
a
small
area
of
bangladesh
and
east
india
in
this
8
000
square
mile
21
000
km2
area
24
of
the
42
tornadoes
which
are
known
to
have
killed
100
or
more
people
occurred
1
this
is
probably
due
to
the
high
population
density
and
poor
economic
status
of
the
area
as
well
as
a
lack
of
early
warning
system
1
most
of
the
rest
occurred
in
the
united
states
in
1953
or
earlier
before
tornado
prediction
efforts
began
the
only
tornado
on
this
list
to
occur
during
the
21st
century
is
the
joplin
tornado
which
occurred
on

uncertainty
edit
there
are
many
sources
of
uncertainty
in
the
statistics
mentioned
on
this
page
before
the
20th
century
and
even
until
recently
in
third
world
countries
records
keeping
was
spotty
at
best
before
the
american
civil
war
slave
deaths
were
often
not
included
in
tornado
death
tolls
fatalities
of
africans
in
the
southern
us
were
routinely
not
counted
through
the
1940s
and
in
some
cases
into
the
1950s
most
tornadoes
from
many
decades
ago
had
no
official
government
report
on
damage
or
casualties
so
statistics
must
be
compiled
from
local
newspapers
which
are
not
always
a
reliable
consistent
or
comprehensive
source
many
death
tolls
were
published
with
people
still
missing
or
with
people
critically
injured
and
likely
to
die
later
news
media
red
cross
and
other
counts
don
t
necessarily
distinguish
whether
a
death
was
directly
caused
by
a
tornado
and
can
include
deaths
during
cleanup
efforts
routine
counting
of
fatalities
began
in
the
us
in
the
1950s
in
bangladesh
and
india
exact
populations
of
towns
were
often
not
known
so
most
death
figures
are
approximate
individual
tornado
descriptions
go
into
more
detail
on
these
uncertainties
officials
in
some
areas
for
example
in
russia
and
the
ussr
and
parts
of
europe
until
recent
years
denied
that
tornadoes
occur
in
those
areas
thus
fatalities
may
not
be
counted
as
tornadic
there
is
also
meteorological
uncertainty
with
the
nature
of
many
tornadoes
on
this
list
before
the
1970s
and
even
now
outside
of
north
america
most
tornado
paths
were
not
thoroughly
surveyed
to
ensure
that
the
storm
was
indeed
a
single
tornado
and
not
a
series
of
tornadoes
from
the
same
storm
a
tornado
family
often
a
single
supercell
can
produce
a
new
tornado
soon
after
or
even
before
the
demise
of
an
old
tornado
giving
the
appearance
to
many
observers
that
a
single
tornado
has
caused
all
the
damage
on
this
list
if
it
is
likely
that
the
tornado
was
in
fact
two
or
more
tornadoes
it
will
appear
in
italics
