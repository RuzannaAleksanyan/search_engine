fault
the
glassy
surface

commencing

he
was
on
a
high
altitude
combat
exercise
with
three
other
mirages
on
17
may
when
his
aircraft
dived
into
the
sea
around
50
nautical
miles
93
km
north
east
of
williamtown
drummond
had
sounded
no
alert
nor
had
the
jet
suffered
any
obvious
structural
failure
the
other
mirages
searched
the
area
but
spotted
only
an
oil
slick
an
air
and
sea
search
continued
for
several
days
but
did
not
locate
drummond
or
his
aircraft
41
the
court
of
inquiry
into
the
accident
investigated
several
possible
explanations
including
engine
problems
oxygen
system
failure
and
pilot
incapacity
it
found
that
the
mirage
was
fully
serviceable
prior
to
the
flight
the
inquiry
also
considered
drummond
s
flying
ability
and
physical
fitness
it
noted
that
he
was
an
above
average
pilot
with
exceptional
leadership
abilities
based
on
career
assessments
and
evaluation
by
the
usaf
during
his
recent
tour
of
duty
in
vietnam
his
medical
officer
testified
that
drummond
had
been
fully
assessed
four
months
previously
and
was
fit
to
fly
without
restriction
margaret
drummond
was
also
called
as
a
witness
she
said
that
over
the
past
six
weeks
her
husband
had
suffered
instances
of
severe
headache
double
vision
chest
pain
and
heartburn
in
response
the
medical
officer
opined
that
drummond
may
have
had
a
heart
attack
in
the
air
pointing
out
that
a
cardiovascular
issue
that
was
manageable
on
the
ground
could
be
exacerbated
under
flying
conditions
and
meant
that
the
pilot
would
be
unable
to
use
his
radio
the
court
concluded
that
such
an
attack
was
the
most
likely
explanation
for
the
accident
the
air
officer
commanding
operational
command
considered
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
cause
lay
in
pilot
incapacity
41
later
that
year
the
former
chairman
of
the
chiefs
of
staff
committee
air
chief
marshal
sir
frederick
scherger
was
quoted
as
saying

commodore

considered
that
drummond
was
well
on
track
to
become
the
chief
of
the
air
staff
and
speculated
that
he
may
have
kept
quiet
about
his
symptoms
to
avoid
any
restrictions
