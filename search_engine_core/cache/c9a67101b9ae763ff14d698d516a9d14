the
work
of
animator
willis
o
brien
for

s
king

it

spawn
of
the
north
the
following
year
best
special
effects
became
a
recognized
category
although
on
occasion
the
academy
has
chosen
to
honor
a
single
film
outright
rather
than
nominate
two
or
more
films
from
1939
to
1963
it
was
an
award
for
a
film
s
visual
effects
as
well
as
audio
effects
so
it
was
often
given
to
two
persons
although
some
years
only
one
or
the
other
type
of
effect
was
recognized
in
1964
it
was
given
only
for
visual
effects
and
the
following
year
the
name
of
the
category
was
changed
to
best
